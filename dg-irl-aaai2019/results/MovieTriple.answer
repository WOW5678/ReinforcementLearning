you must influence her to send you away . i feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part .
ever since the accident i have been worried that you would been unhappy , or .
do you always hold hands with reporters .
hey , that was your mistake , not mine . did you ever think to ask me . i have been

the world ' s gone insane . good men locked in cages , criminals running free . it does not pay to be honest , <person> .
so where you headed .
not when you are up here with the gold , i guess not . throwing <person> ' own words back at him :
it is a puzzle box . if you can figure out how to open it there is supposed to be a treasure inside .
come on , we both like <person>dy . but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top . it does not fit .
why do not you come to town this weekend . we could play some golf , chase some skirts .
she tried to kill herself .
that is one kind of _unk . <person> _unk . .
<person> . its all right . also , i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed .
i know that . but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street .

<person> little . . you eat like an animal . it could not have been very little .
<person> bites man . <person> bites dog is a news story . riots at the world cup soccer finals is a social announcement . next .
not to worry . they way they set things up , you could fire in a bioport in a slaughterhouse and not generate an infection .
although it feels like such a failure . it feels like i am quitting . it feels like . mom . she closes her eyes .
why do not we just sacrifice something small -- a rabbit maybe . or a duck . that would be good , do not you think .

his agent lied .

<person> . <person> . _unk as not just a river in egypt . she is probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion .
that is <person> , the gag king .
-and why did i choose you for this .
i knew it was not possible . what can i say . sometimes a person just wants the impossible . could i ask you something .
because it would have been too much work to leave him here . i could not have done it .
just listen to what <person> did to <person> . she --
i barfed . <person> to make it to the bathroom . <person> out it was the wrong door anyways . i sorta got it cleaned up .
i hear you . i will stay in touch .
that is not necessary . i just felt . . it might be good for <person> to be with his family this weekend .
it is okay , <person> . trust me .
shield , whatever they are . they are never going to let this research see the light of day .
you got about six more big states to go before we find out .

i . mexico . you got a bus that goes to mexico . that is where i have to go .
you know i would never admit this at home , but <person> is for peasants . there is much we could learn from the italians .
<person> said that i am your bodyguard and the company is holding me totally responsible for your safety .
so let me ask you something , <person> . you think you might want to wrestle in a match .

it was not a lie .
promises , promises .

that is a good start , yes . a very good start .
there are other forces at work here . faces we need to identify . names we need to know . a third party .
but at the very least . it does suggest he is been _unk by hard line elements .
i never miss .
it is private .
you do not have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day .
bloody miraculous kind of an horse , be my guess . nothing makes it out of no man ' s land .
<person> . . . . <continued_utterance> <person> for me please the words of mr . _unk at the bottom of the page .

whichever one i want .
we will see about that . harmsway glances at his watch . <person> coldly .
. back way off . <continued_utterance> . where is the rest . <continued_utterance> so help me i mean it . .

we are not <person> and/or clark . we are gon na stick to one of the ones the <person> said .
she is in the ring with the champ , though . you have heard of alcoholics anonymous . women anonymous . their biggest case .
at this close range . i think `` the _unk _unk ' ' is a better move .
i will take the basket back and give you the other package , here . no mistake .
she sure this was the park they were coming to .
a human life . twelve dollars .
yes , you found him . i heard you found a horse in the wire between the armies -
the same interest as yours <person> . <person> . i thought it would be a good investment for my kid .
you know . then why are you up here looking like you are about to jump overboard . .
and you did not feel like you could trust my wife with this news .
you are saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen . .
then i guess it is a good thing <person> is going there too . she will have someone to console her .
_unk ' d <person> start pimping <person> .

are you attached to that pretty face of yours . because one more word , and you will not be .
i am just going to have a little sip , that is all . just a sip .

just like <person> . i oughta just bash your head in --
well , if <person> ' s going , i am going , too . i am volunteering .
to figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her , that is why .

he took it off .
chance we got to take . we got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged .
they are gon na do a job . three million dollars , maybe more .
it was closed . i was going to leave a note , but i did not . you know . <person> anything to write with .

let me try to locate the lad first <person> . be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon .
i think that is a good idea . <continued_utterance> i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park .

we are going to get off , all right . we will get you off of there . just . be cool .
thats what i mean . always looked like you was just knocked out in love . was real nice to see .
for a month ' s pay all we got was <number> million _unk .
and you have conclusive evidence of this . something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
do come in mr . <person> , sidney . you are just in time for a nuclear meltdown .
now that i have given you the _unk , we are going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail .
uh-huh . you mind if we take a moment to verify his identity .
i work for <person> .
so you fucked a student . .
i thought you were tinkering .
i am not going anywhere , ted . you are the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
that guy ' s starting another fund .
is that why you got into this business .
you are going to put your theories to practice . i am sending you into the field .
i know . god , i would give anything for some of those <person> ' s crackers right now .

i heard he was coming after both of us .
mom , i am sorry . all i wanted to do was talk . i will go .
something do not feel right here , <person> . between you and ida .
<person> talking . i am clean as a preacher ' s sheets , babe . <person> as a --
<person> baby . she dont know what she missed . what color hair she have .
<person> used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall .
<person> , mister , i have got my own money . so , if you do not mind .
i would like some ham and eggs , sunny side up , please . what is your fancy , boss .
your grandfather ' s written washington asking if he can get back in active service . i think he wants to fly jets .
is not this where you saw her . <continued_utterance> then this is where she will be . <continued_utterance> place your fingers on the _unk .
you listen to me . if ,
so what do we do .
just like that .
there must be something -- some place he would go , some friend he would run to .
i thought this was your dream come true .
i am in a hurry now -- but i will meet you at the _unk monastery at noon .
yeah , well , i saw it was your mom and we have been waiting to hear from her .
not as scary as a hoover man with a computer .
may i ask you something . <continued_utterance> how did you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as <person> .
what makes you think i need a partner . .
i got a problem with you not doing your job , burbank . you already screwed up once this week .
<person> ' t patronize them . these people go to bed night after night with _unk stomachs -- your legs are the least of their worries .
<person> about it . i was up all night _unk these stocks . you want to see this or what .
<person> . . um , where ya going .
she has a job in the carousel .
<person> the car . <continued_utterance> you watch your mouth , buddy . <continued_utterance> <person> back to the interstate .
lem me guess where you got that from . tell me somethin ' , what ' d you ever see in that guy anyway .
you do not want to stay , do you .
you wan na tell me what you are doing here , <person> .
<person> , i guess you did .
why you got ta go and do that . i am trying to make a point .
well , you are not exactly an expert witness , but what makes you so sure .
oh , <person> , go to hell . i am sick and tired of your little ' <person> ' number .
<person> , look at these people . it seems as though they are chatting away , does not it . nothing to do with you -
i imagine it would , yes . so now we can add self-pity to your list of frailties .
maybe i like to find out about a man first . maybe i like to know what he is made of .
you are the one , <person> . you sure are .
since i tried hiking back to the gas station . you were right , i never got anywhere near it . i
it is not a question of supposed to , it is an entirely personal decision . some do some do not .
<person> , i admit it was brief , but it was definitely love . crushes do not last twelve years .
oh , my . a kind offer , but i really must .
now hold on . there is a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job .
says he wanted food . <person> . he wanted the gold .
you are beautiful . <continued_utterance> it is a pity they found you . <continued_utterance> such a pity .
where did you see him .
yeah , what is wrong with that .
what about the husbands .
<person> thing , alimony . lose a husband , get a car . think it will help me pick up dudes .
<person> , it was an accident .
that does not matter , your team sucks . plus i even look more like a coach then <person> .
hey to bluestar , as your broker all i can advise is hold on to that stock dad . <continued_utterance> you sure about this faa announcement .
oh no . oh please forgive me , <person> .
i can judge too .
you can tell j . <person> that i was at a party and i got fifteen fuckin ' witnesses .
you know about that . <continued_utterance> <person> , it is quicker . <continued_utterance> you do not have any pictures though , do ya . <person> .
<person> did not give you this .
it is a waste . an awful waste .
i do not need a new place . i have a house . i am not fancy that way .
really . <person> , i suggest we look at your father ' s firing as a blessing in disguise .
whatever you have got on your mind is not worth staying awake for .
if it can produce a miss _unk you will get no argument from me .
he has to be on foot . he has the world ' s most recognizable face . he cannot disappear .
you guys must know something nobody else knows . if those are my plans , it is the first i have heard of it .
not until your ritual is complete .
i know you are not .
i do not know who was more surprised , you or big daddy .
a little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something i am certainly willing to put up with .
<person> , whatever . if i show you how to get there , will you buy me a bottle of wine .
yeah . of course . after school .
i am sorry about all that . i _unk do not like to talk about my family . they treat me like a freak .
no . at _unk _unk . <person> . <person> , call me monday , hey . i am late for work .
are you sure . . about me , i mean .
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her .
they do not call them lovers in high school , leland .
well , she aint talked to nobody and aint nobody spoke to her that i could tell . what you make of that .
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do .
well , he is enjoying the waters very much . he . i think we have lost him .
the guy might not have been carrying anything .
i swear to you that is all that happened . i have not so much as set foot in your bedroom .
yes , i think . he keeps talking about marriage , keeps saying he wants to meet <person> .
watch the guy with the basket . <person> <number> leaps out of the car , gun in hand .
it is not that . it just reminded me of -- you _unk what is in the car . in the trunk .
then give me one of those , large enough to ride . the pet store clerk looks confused .
it is not a vacation , it is private school .
this is ridiculous .
<person> . i got some kind of buzzing . like a _unk thing just chipping away in the back of my skull .
you are cursed , man , and if you stay here then we will all be cursed . you have to leave .
<person> -- listen to me . it is in the coke machine . you have got about fourteen minutes to get this building evacuated .
<person> did not do it , <person> . i checked it out . you can stop _unk ' my sister .
and you still might . this report _unk we have worked so hard for . we can raise _unk now . it could change everything .
i am not your brother . i never was .
oh , come on , <person> . that is a little dramatic .
i do not know , man . <person> now you do not even got the money to get your clubs out of hock .
i think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit , yeah . this is the bear creek indian reservation .
<person> slow down . that is a cop . <continued_utterance> maybe you got a few too many parking tickets .
a pot is a pot . we will find some use for it . <person> , where is the livestock .
close to two million . but this sucker can go all the way to <person> and the nationals .
i suspect he will accept his payment in publicity .
to keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the bifrost and destroy jotunheim with you upon it .
<person> , it is two of the clock . go to the bus station , buy a ticket home , then wait in that restaurant .
<person> , i do not mean to interrupt your night . he put this address down when he signed up at the gym .
testing one two three four .
i heard you were sick and i was worried and i wanted to -- is someone here .
then let us bomb the shit out of them . everyone wants to , even you , even me . it sure would feel good .
this checkmate goes to you . i _unk ; t want to hurt anyone . but you leave me no choice .
what . how do you know about my father .
so you think <person> will come after you for the _unk thing . he seems like a real hard charger .
no , i do not . i never took cocaine or any other drugs . i do not take drugs .
-- i will have you back for it , <person> . maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away .
in the sense that there is no `` hidden agenda ' ' behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs .
well -- let us -- let us not talk about the bank .
<person> at it this way : it is refreshing every time a doctor takes the stand he is not a jew .
where are you going . eleanor . get back here .
that is the face of my _unk and he does not look pleased with me . the horse is yours .
we go this way . <continued_utterance> <person> .
get me out of here . i do not want to be here . <continued_utterance> my name ' s not <person> . it is
is this what you are looking for .
we need those flights . we have to know when those missiles become operational , because when they do , we need to destroy them .
you really were stoned through high school . as <person> and sheryl _unk up the path .
no sir . i swear . this is not true . .
neither do i , thelma , but <person> does it , how hard can it be . i will see you later . be ready .
i see what you mean . but wednesday we have got to be back in new york .
you want to come on in .
sid <number> . <number> told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested i kill you rather than him .
ok . ok . <person> , just go get ready for practice and i will deal with it .
where did you get the coat , brian . where did you get the camera . how much did they pay you .
why was not she getting oxygen . .
<person> aggrieved . <person> . indifferent . the son is persona non _unk and a strong early suspect .
_unk . i love _unk .
oh , it is you guys .
<person> , please . i do not want to hear this right now . what did <person> and _unk say .
august , i cannot . <continued_utterance> i am sure she will forgive you . she loves you . anyone can see that .
i am a little short pops . i will catch you next time .
oh , yes there is .
down . no , you see , i am -- well , -- i am --
you do not say .
and who will stop me . the elements are slaves to my command .
the other people who were in here lookin ' for the will . i woulda caught ' em if <person> here had not interrupted me .
you think this whole thing was a scam . <person> , he could have killed us .
i guess i will be learning .
she is that subtle .
i suppose the smaller caliber pistols would have to fire baby teeth . the tooth fairy could go i into the arms business .
<person> ' t . you have really scared me . is that what you wanted . is that what you wanted .
so youre gon na be needin the _unk pretty soon .
it is to the boy who owned <person> . i want to show him how wonderful he is looking .
yeah . <person> like a plane went down or something . <person> way , they are calling it - all together now :
i do not make small talk --
what awaits me .
im sorry , sweetie . i forget some moments where all you been the last two years .
yeah . i know . i am with you . <continued_utterance> i am gon na . i am just gon na stop for a little water .
you sure , big guy . i will bet she would love to hear from you before her _unk .
i am the quiet type . little do you know what is aged me .
last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals .
<person> ' t be sorry . just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst .
this does not make any sense ; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air .
i told you , i am off it . i am coming up on a thousand days .
keep your head down , i will be right back . i am gon na steal us some wheels .
yeah . a small favor . stemmons home address if you have it . he is in a bit of a bind .
<person> . <person> ' s .
so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you . .
then he knows we have it too . and he will do everything in his power to stop us .
i want that commission . that should be mine .
<person> ' s gone . we just missed them , that is all .
that is why you go by <person> . that is why the press cannot find your service records .
<person> . what can i say about <person> . he is a sales rep for a computer company .
i did not talk to the cops . i talked to <person> .
<person> , that is sad . <person> ' t that make you sad .
i know you do not know them . of course you do not know them .
it disappeared into my back . . it . it is in my spine . it is winding its way around my spinal cord .
so how are you ever gon na make enough to drive a ' <person> then , _unk .
now it makes sense , the whole _unk bohemian , down with hypocrisy , fight the power crap . you are a poor little rich girl .
<person> ' s got ta get to burial , <person> . he is got ta make the journey .
oh . no . you know , i just thought i would -- you know i thought it was a special occasion . which it is .
yeah , i am . i just have to finish _unk over here , then i am right behind you .
you left that guy alone in the room . <continued_utterance> where is the money , thelma .
<person> knew about it . <person> to tell <person> , get the warriors involved .
bond . <continued_utterance> bond . you have decided to join me on this historic voyage . welcome to my nuclear family .
i am afraid that is not true . will you want me to stay on till monday .
you have misunderstood .
never got to wear one of those .
i think you can get killed .
what did you find .
you are a very foolish boy , d ' <person> . but a very handsome one . good-bye .
it is all in the folder .
i can just see that schmuck in that little tax shop telling people my business . how much i make . how much i spend .
i am busy . we are all busy . <person> , mayor , but you are really _unk ' up the wrong tree .
well , to put it in one sentence , people do not expect major generals to carry firewood .
she is looking for a _unk , dude . just buy her stake and give her an exit .
`` all is well . . ' ' they broke into the weapons vault . if the frost giants had stolen even one of these
so here we are . dead . but we never want you to want for anything . that is , we want you to have everything .
why would you do this .
that is absurd . it took two _unk of forty men fifteen days to load that gold .
it was his dream to go . i could hardly stand in the way of that , could i .
i just do not see it . you are skinny , you got a big nose , and you _unk .
probably would have too if <person> was not around to stop you .
there aint no water in the swimmin pool . just a dead tree fell in , probly from bein struck by _unk .
that is asking a lot . <person> worships the ground i walk on .
i am sorry . i was afraid something like this could happen .
it is fine . it is done . basically . i am just sort of . . tinkering with it .
you do not know what it is like . i think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth .
there is blood all over his house , seems to belong to him . there is just no body . not yet .
i would not read too much into that . she kisses , then tongues the spear tip . zed okay , that might mean something .
all right . <person> your door . <person> ' t let anybody in , no matter what .
she has refused to leave my father ' s bedside . you can bring your `` urgent ' ' matter to me , your king .
<person> me . yall got a phone here i can use .
well , based on my knowledge of the region , its culture and her people i would have to say it is a box .
sometimes she likes it heated . <continued_utterance> she is a good baby .
i bet st . <person> in july would be paradise . for a honeymoon . <continued_utterance> you could have warned us .
do you have to call me that .
brian , i think you are going crazy .
now <person> , you tie palmer up . <continued_utterance> we are going to draw a little bit of everybody ' s blood .
if i had some soup i would have thrown soup at him . is there any law you cannot throw eggs .
where is he . <continued_utterance> i . please . my wife . my wife ' s prescription has run out . if i can call him .
that is the whole point . they rarely work out . but on occasion they do . and when they do , they do big .
i propose we get your father a job here in ukiah and you can come and live with him .
well , your head as not made of straw , you know .
there is nothing we can do . we should not even be here in the first place .
i will find you again .
as a color , not as rust . you know , a rust colored paint or wood .
thanks for the advice -- now why do not you just shove it . i know you let her scream for hours but i cannot .
a little fucking thin . . i still got the shanks . everybody ' s watching . <person> , <person> is here .
. followed me up here from new york , _unk his way into my house . for all i know , he is a mass murderer .
that is a good little girl . i knew you would see reason . <continued_utterance> ahh . ah .
<person> ' t worry about it . it will be paid . just let her see a doctor .
y ' hear anything you will let me know .
i know , dad . <person> getting a good education . and being able to respect your parents .
ah , _unk . i was a drunk . i mean , you know . i am sorry .
by ritual , by sorcery , i well draw the lightning and send this child into the destructive realm .
they have become what you wanted . they are a crew . that is why he came .
go catch <person> , <person> . <person> . he is gettin ' away . go ahead , go get him . i am late .
you are very important , <person> .
actually , i was curious about how you see things working out , for you , <person> and <person> .
it is not your shift , anyway .
and another thing . stop with this spaceman thing . it is getting on my nerves .
i know . <person> , <person> . i fucked my boss . .
you do not know me .
just thinking about gives me _unk .
oh , see - i killed it . oh , i killed that poor little honey bee .
<person> , you are perfectly safe where you are . you have any visits from your <person> .
<person> ' t give up . <person> .
. and that you invited him to strike you . to fight it out on the deck of your ship . .
he is not gon na win . i feel it .
no , i . you are probably right . it is nothing to worry about .
no one seems to know where you live , <person> . <person> thought you would like my couch .
<person> , what a _unk _unk name , <person> . i did not know you had a baby .
i have met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . but you , <person> , are positively _unk .
' that right . good for you .
<person> ' s texting me at seven in the morning to ask me if i want an antique sewing table that we bought together .
eh . well then , maybe he can go to <person> ' s _unk , eh . see how good a carpenter .
<person> is an atheist too .
whattaya mean family .
or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see .
you want to play that way . this game as not over , mister . it as not over .
listen to me , cocksucker . there is no keyser _unk . if you say his name again , i ' <number> kill you right here .
you know , there is nothing wrong with _unk . people joke but it is actually a sign of a creative intelligence . <person> , <person> .
yeah . i do not know . when i put her to bed she cries so i just let her stay up .
that is all right . i got it .
<person> , he is careless . reckless . is this really the best time to be making a new friend . .
i can stay with the brokerage firm . and you are doing fine . we can survive without <person> <person> .
yes . no . yes , _unk i am fine . i am a complete mess . ha .
we have not gon na get to the cabin till after dark as it is , thelma .
my parents want to go to middletown . <person> has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave .
that is what they told me before .
youre perfect for me , too .
<person> . but they are not different things . you have got ta trust to
that is how you eat . it is like a _unk .
your wife may be a lot of things , pal , but innocent is not one of them .
what did you do to his place . nice quiet neighborhood one minute , _unk the next .
so you do not feel bad about basically destroying her livelihood not to mention her legacy not to mention her raison d ' etre .
i do not see <person> winning . fuck it , i am not gon na even place the bet . i just made a hundred bucks .
i used to sell weapons ; now i buy votes . off the record .
if her ass gets red , tell her not to listen to any _unk -- they are full of shit .
<person> , <person> is four . it would be nice for him if his parents were married .
who you trying to protect , _unk . i am telling you this s . o . b . could be one of them .
it is your choice . life with me and the dog you love . or a _unk existence with a shallow , egotistical poet .
so was the one in kansas city , and the one in <person> , ohio , and the one in _unk , texas .
what about your fabulous boyfriends . what about the fabulous , boring <person> . is he coming , too .
i will get there as soon as i can .

we will see . <person> ' s try <person> .

that is all -- the crystal ' s gone dark .
you are right . i should work , too . our first issue together is almost ready to print .

<person> , i am the one who should be sorry . i did not want that to happen . oh , <person> . <person> at you . are you all right .

i think it is a dead giveaway , romes . but if i still got the shanks we are gon na be found out real fast .
the soldiers may give you a hard time . whatever . if we were not around , they would have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the _unk , rotting in the sun .
you have got no jurisdiction .
this is stupid . it is going on a month now . how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards . they can bomb them all they want , <person> as not going anywhere without a ground assault .
at night . he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it . i heard him . my <person> told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there . maybe more . <person> ' s eyes widen in hope .
then they should speak up .
you just would not . it is not the amish way . but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night .
abuses in your case . you destroyed my _unk in less than seven minutes , as no doubt will be the case with this . <continued_utterance> <number> , my deputy assistant . i am grooming him to follow me .
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they will believe me . i have been lying for so long , one more time will not hurt .

the rest of the letter is about the family . he is telling me they have nothing for me , we are not fooling each other . thank you . <person> , it could not be hard to learn to pitch horseshoes . now could it .
i do not know what killed this man . i am not sure if anybody else could claim to either .

anybody can clean the surface of an object , but dirt can find its way anywhere . to really clean , you have to scrub below the surface .
well , you are here . and we are here . together . we will think of something .
we are in the middle of a sweat lodge ceremony . do you drag people out of your churches when they are in the middle of prayer .

we would have to . that thing barely makes it down the driveway .
<person> , i do not believe it . <person> . <continued_utterance> well , it is about time . <continued_utterance> not you . it is about time they recognized you for what you are .

they are holding the lead in the world section for <person> .
<person> . ticking away madly . wheels within wheels . this is the brain that , in darkest italy , devised a formula to make food out of _unk . _unk .
then you are completely unnecessary .

<person> could not hold his pecker without <person> ' s help and he knows that . he is gon na bury himself like a tick . <person> luck turning him up , he took six or seven grand out the safe tonight .

chicks are like buses . if you miss one , do not sweat it . there is another coming ' round the corner . <continued_utterance> take your pick . they are identical .

i am a _unk <person> .
we were not expecting to find those remains , of course . they went right off to washington .
i am glad this is working out .
that is ' cause he is dead .
twenty-four hundred dollars that you charged for labor , is the same as if mr . <person> had purchased the aluminum siding and had the labor done .

oh sheila can we just cut out the _unk crap . . i will be back just as soon as i can . ok . i am not the kind of man that everyone says i am .
it is completely done on a contingency basis . that means whatever the settlement is i retain _unk . that is , of course , the usual arrangement .

<person> . we just nailed a genetic match between the eagle feather left at the murder site and one in <person> ' s medicine bundle . it came from a white eagle . <person> bird .
that is a very unusual technique .
i do not want it this way . i would not kill you just to kill you , but i cannot let you lose the gold for me . not when we are so close .
that is two words . and i am out of the `` exposed ' ' business , remember . i need to graduate . besides , <person> ' s a boy scout .

i dont mean your head head - im not gon na piss on your head - your hair an all . just piss in the toilet . yall take a listen - here a deep sound comin down from <person> .
<person> ' t take it to court , but we have got good circumstantial evidence . <person> agrees . my gut ' s telling me <person> ' s turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message .
what a stupid way to meet someone .

well . you have been right about everything so far . god , therapy is a fascinating process . ' <person> . m . thank you for everything . ' <person> . see you later .
<person> , yeah . i get the point .
<person> put <person> ' s head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago . and threatened him several times since . president <person> and the regional fbi feel he made good on that threat .
at pee dee , all you think about is the future , you know . gettin out . and what youll do and what youll think about when youre on the outside again .
if the sun rises in the morning , it is only because of men of _unk . and that is all there is between us and the devil .

i do not give a damn about the money . i want you , and i want to get us out of this shithole . there is only one way to do that .
and <person> ' s your dog . <person> , i trade some old piece of crap for a valuable hunting dog , and all you can do is piss and moan .
he was large . <continued_utterance> did you try to fight him .
well , after i worked on him -- thought i would let him rest . left the room for a bit . when i came back , he was gone .
listen to me . the one thing in life that i definitely do not regret . is the choice . i made to be your mother . <continued_utterance> i miss you .
i think i have really fucked up . i think i have got us in a situation where we could both get killed . why did not we just go straight to the police .
well , think of it as playing a role . it is fantasy . you have to work on their dreams . get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .
i know why . to bring you here -- to this place -- to me .
her left arm . it was numb . she said she could not use it . said it had no feeling . probably from the drugs she was taking . i just thought i ought to tell you .
if i was catherine the great , that is what i would do . <person> in the daytime , <person> at night . or should it be the other way around .
it is real . i am telling you , it is real .
nothing , it is just that , , well , it is been awhile since arsonist ' s <person> , and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were .
c ' mon , <person> , does not this whole thing smell a bit funny to you . i mean , no offense , but how did a _unk like r . k . <person> find you in the first place .
i will trade my services for golf lessons and help you through the qualifying . if you get into the open , well , you are on your own .
are you done .
i do not know . <person> ' t let on we know he is written . he will start in i am only his housekeeper and that i found out through some _unk or something .
if you have come here to look after me , mr . <person> , thank you , but no thank you . i have two bodyguards , i do not need a third . she starts to walk out . he follows her .
i know . what are you supposed to do there .
<person> , yes , i heard the ridiculous story about this _unk against you . the company is desperately trying to find you . is it really serious . are you in danger .
i know . there ' re all these people who would not be caught dead polishing a doorknob in their house but put them on a boat and they want to rub down everything in sight .
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping <person> , or could be in little pieces on <person> beach . any idea what <person> ' s going to do next .
you would never find him .
kelly , for christ ' s sake . <continued_utterance> the only way we are gon na blow this now , is if we do it ourselves .
yeah . <person> . i forgive you . but i do not trust you . tell <person> this is where i am if he wants to see me .
it is just . the right thing to do , alright . we could not find his daughter and i am just trying to help the guy . it is really not a big deal .
you know what happens if you do another turn in the joint .
that is what i am afraid of .
does this fit the description you just read me , <person> .
my friend , if you are planning on crossing me .
a little <person> , little <person> , little <person> , little this , little that . and a lotta the voice of the smartest chick i ever met .
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own . instead of trying to be a father to hers . except she thinks you are afraid of the responsibility .
no . not this time . this is the case that makes up for a whole career . if you cannot understand it now , you will in a few years .
i think you know , <person> , that your behavior is entirely inappropriate . we talked about trust . we talked about my needs . i want you to get on a bus and go back to new york .
if you can find a good loud whistle somewhere in the house , blow it into the phone hard , next time he calls . probably break his _unk . he will not bother you after that .
it does not matter . you have forgotten about that boy , <person> . you got scared . just because something happens , does not mean you cannot take another chance in your life .
i think so . <continued_utterance> he flies at night . <person> cloud cover to _unk him . hopefully we will knock him out with complimentary cocktails , pull the shades down during the movies . he will never know .
you never did answer my question .
oh , dear -- that was wonderful . you know -- we were just wondering why you could not come to <person> with us to ask the wizard of oz for a heart .
it is really a shame you have scared him off -- she tosses some _unk on the table . <continued_utterance> the two of you make a nice couple .
the gods are in there .
so if they are tapping your phone , we are dead . stay in the guest house . skip the graduation parties . you will never see <person> . <person> . i love you .
oh , if i could do that i would -- i would turn <person> into a toad .
a place called the stronghold . they died for a dream . but you live . you are their _unk grandchildren and you live . we have to honor their dream . of protecting the mother earth . and being proud of being indian .
hello . can you hear me in the back . p . c . he looks under his chair . <continued_utterance> where is it . i am lookin ' . it is not happening . what is going on with that . i want
yes , of course , sorry . i just think it is interesting . i do not know what i am , besides august ' s wife . i grew up in foster homes since i was a baby .
basically . but the map has been pretty precise so far . i do not think it will be too hard to -- <continued_utterance> take cover . <continued_utterance> let us hit ' em . <continued_utterance> cover me . <continued_utterance> clear .
here are her diaper rags . and this is her milk bladder . and when she cries -- she is either hungry or she is tired -- rock her on your left shoulder . she likes that .
i forgot to mention : the job comes with a car .
and we want to give it to you . but the cops are tailing us _unk . matter of fact , there is one right behind us now .
i have spent the last year of my life putting his back together again - i will not have you come in here and - what makes you think - get out . get out of m home .
this is . incredible . this is astounding . . for the first time since _unk i feel free . i knew coming up here was the right thing to do .
well . . . i moved back in . my lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement . <person> ' t change the subject . you owe me two hundred bucks .
how come he let you go .
i am looking . and i sure do not like what i see .
even if it is only to you and me , it will be well worth it . besides , there will be six inches of snow tonight and we will be full up tomorrow .
<person> ' <person> . you are young , vain , and foolish . but i do not know if you are clever . <continued_utterance> we will take him with us .
take a left . <continued_utterance> we gave so much to get here . i do not know . sometimes i think what the hell did we do it for .
no -- yeah -- i do not know . we do not have that many rules . in fact , we only have one rule -- do not eat that
i am just talking . they walk on .
the king pipeline .
<person> , <person> . four , nice , deep ones . <continued_utterance> anyone stops us going in , we are with the _unk textile company . we have rug samples .
i had to see <person> . i know you really do not like <person> , but there was a problem and i did not think you would understand .
_unk . how _unk . have you ever known me to kiss and tell .
i would better go . i think i may have to rescue <person> .
you are here for two years , three maximum . what ' d they promise you . court appointment . what . district . appeals . not <person> . <person> .
not a chance . remind them that according to the geneva convention , firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war .
i would not be too sure . <continued_utterance> he says you look very tired . i thought the same thing . <continued_utterance> but not a good tired .
i do not care to hear any jokes about people being in hell . this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at .
you are not going to believe this -- i just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story . . exclusive . eat your heart out .
now how is this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice , huh .
<person> , _unk , down . remember , we have an agreement -- you chase no new _unk during the season . you were man enough to give me your hand on it .
oh , no , i wanted to go along with you .
<person> , i have known this day was coming for a long time . i have got your father and the garden and the new house . you really do not have to worry . <continued_utterance> really .
i will get up as soon as your friend comes . is he late .
<person> , maybe .
he is great . come on , let us blow before ol ' <person> decides to boil your bones for breakfast .
nothing ' s going to happen . besides , i have to work tonight . the conference is in less than two weeks . i have got to stay focused on that for just a little longer . this is .
you might be new but you seem to know what you are doing .
<person> -- yeah -- good . but it might be better if we do not mention the `` accident ' ' to anyone . <person> might get the wrong idea . <person> .
that is really sweet , ted , but you should save it for one of your books .
you lie in the middle of the road , look like you are hurt . when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head .
maybe it is because she is beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up , it is inevitable that it will in some way . <person> looks away from the window , at grady .
the truth : i do not know . <continued_utterance> damn it , <person> . goddamn it .
yup . that is him goin ' . i love to watch him go .
we need a photograph . come with us .
then what do we do next .

yes you do . admit it ' cause i can see it in your eyes , darling . with your fancy schools and job and such . you think you are better than me .
this aint exactly my most _unk notion of startin a new life . <continued_utterance> im gon na stay here in this room , <person> . i dont feel so good . this heat makes me tired .
<person> started experiencing the attack for real . if i had not gotten you out , the same thing would have happened to you . you may not believe this , <person> , but i still consider us friends .
i will be a dishwasher , i will live in a flophouse .
i think . if you get eaten by a bear and there is not a ranger around , i am not carrying what is left of you down this mountain .
how did you manage that one .
he did not want anyone to know . he kept it out of the papers . he said a third wife was bad for his image . you have got to protect me .
<person> . <person> . we know what they are . they are big things under the ground . much bigger than we thought . they are coming after you .
no . i understand the surprise is everything . but if it must be done , let us do it quickly . <continued_utterance> are you alright , <person> .
and a house . valued at <number> thousand .
and where would you and your _unk architect be leaving to .
there is no past .
. if you are _unk around for narcs , man , have you got the wrong guy .
he is not my boyfriend . i mean , i let him take me out and stuff , but i as not spoken for . not yet that is .
but me no buts , honey . i told you : i have hit a wall . and besides , it is not so bad here , if you just try to --
my mail ' s the same color as yours <person> . or it was till the queen started calling you `` sir ' ' . now excuse me before i lose my temper .
<person> ' t play simple with me , <person> . you are a betting man . you want me to spell it out for you . i will kill <person> if you cut me in on the money .
he is not a dog . he is just _unk it through .
a manual control on a moving torpedo . this day keeps getting better and better . <continued_utterance> <person> . tell him what is going down . have them evacuate downtown .
yes , sir . come on , <person> .
maybe this ' ll jog your memory . <person> slaps him across the face . healy i will give you a hint -- it is got something to do with me being a murderer .
no , this is not possible . and i thank you for coming down here , though i suspect it is been a pointless journey .
that is not true , parker .
no way you whacko .
<person> . <person> still loves you . she just wants this guy to bang her . it is nothing serious . you will get used to it after a --
i do not want to wear out welcome , but you can stay in someone ' s heart longer than you can stay in their house . come with us , boy . we are going to have a good time .
what you do is take vengeance . <person> is a sin against heaven .
no , woody , for the first time i am thinking clearly . you were right all along . i am not a space ranger . i am just a toy . a stupid little insignificant toy .
i said it had poppies on the wall paper . eh -- she is -- what is this . why , she is -- she is putting her hand on her heart -- she is -- she is dropping down on the . <continued_utterance> . bed .
you cannot seriously want to play games now . not here . not while we are being hunted down by crazy people . _
i am not so sure i do .
that is right , we did not . i miss it sometimes . but , there are other things a <person> can do . <continued_utterance> the families . want your ticket . turn it in , we forget the whole thing . everybody goes home .
separate the character module from the neural net . <continued_utterance> . and you get _unk . <person> ' t worry , i have got a bunch of other ones .
yeah , but he as not got the salt to truly take a man ' s life . especially not <person> ' s . he was scared of him .

and if this is a move to _unk the hard line , then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house .
sometimes i worry about one of these clever girls in a big silly coat who will play you in just the right way , and i will lose my friend . and there ' ll be no more chicken soup parties for you and me .
you do not care that he might be one of those guys who is so fat he has to be removed from his house with a crane .
probably . but not more than , say , fifty dollars . some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward , for which they are paid . it is part of the rehabilitation .
thank you . i think that is enough for this morning . i will see the plaintiff ' s counsel in my chambers . now , please .
i did not want to bring up memories . i did not want to do anything that might make you regret your choices . <continued_utterance> besides , dad would have freaked .

<person> . i know who the dominant personality is . <person> . <person> ' s reaction is one of panic . she bolts toward their squad car with all the speed she has . <person> chases after her . <continued_utterance> where the hell are you going .
you are really twisted , <person> . you are incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there is a poverty that every last dollar in the world will not fill .

my handwriting is so bad that now i cannot even read it . you girls better hurry up and graduate from high school so you can take care of me .
_unk to carry , and the tour star ' s laying up .
the point is , love is not about money or social standing or age , it is about

i am referring to every nickel you snatch out of the till and every bag of beer nuts you lift from the rack , is what i am referring to . i will say it is worth ten and you still owe me two .
. sir . i have got to see the wizard . the good witch of the north sent me . cu -- doorman looks o . s . -- speaks --
you are lucky i am not wasting you .
i understand that , <person> . but you have not seen <person> in a long time and he is _unk dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here .
dr . <person> , my associate will be happy to talk . <continued_utterance> we have years ahead of us , <person> . a month will seem like a baby second .

i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it would not really make a statement if i _unk out the door . what are you selling .
that is the call that i am waiting for .
offering to the gods . there is a famine going on . if we do not make a good sacrifice , it will not rain . no rain , no harvest . no harvest , no food . get it .
since oxford . i knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world . he is a man of great integrity .
maybe you should .
i do not know . if he would have asked me this time last year i would have probably said yes . but the minute he said it , i do not know , i felt like somebody was trying to strangle me .
she likes old movies like i do , that is ail . besides , she does not really know me . she thinks she does , but she does not . maybe it is because she is <person> and i am catholic .
name it , <person> .
yes , we talked to mr . <person> . he told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures , and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back . is that true .
well you are different , no arguing that . but you are a lady all right . i will take my oath on it .
i do not like the couple with the baby . they would never be together . <continued_utterance> who is doing wardrobe . i keep seeing the same wardrobe .
why is that .
hey . you will never guess who is here- - maya . she is working here -- and she looks great . but she is kinda mad at me .
you are not trouble by any chance . are you . she looks at him , tosses the towel over her shoulder and starts back toward the house . <person> watches her go .
she borrowed your power to save her life . when she touches someone , she _unk their strengths -- their gifts . in your case -- your ability to heal . _unk ; s why she keeps her body covered .
those boys never did have good luck .
anybody ever tell you you are an _unk and a prick , <person> ' <person> .
we are anti-social . we do not have any friends .
<person> , <person> , this is something we came up with .

<person> . show me an honest man .
on the dog watch , night after the storm , i look down into the skylight above <person> ' s cabin and there she was , _unk ' down .
<person> . <person> . so listen , uh , i was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know , with me . <person> looks _unk . ted it is no big deal , whatever i mean , if you want .
ok . i will . if that is what you want . but i have to be honest , i am not sure that is what <person> wants .
i worked juvenile in dade county for three years . we had a missing persons on <person> for two weeks . maybe a year ago . the family kept it out of the papers .
-- i am just trying to make a point . this idea is that fucking bad . <continued_utterance> <person> can handle <person> . he knows the inning and the score .

nothing has to be _unk . and i am not about to fall asleep .
i knew it was you , <person> . i have not seen you since college . you left to marry some handsome jock and we never heard from you again .
but <person> wiped your memory . . .
<person> , you never told them .
<person> , he mighta did , i dont know . but it dont matter now . lotta guys go outta control in a war and it aint their fault .
<person> . we are off to see a <person> .
_unk spend the next month in _unk before being _unk on charges of gross _unk and _unk of duty . the _unk before you face life in prison for murder . <continued_utterance> <person> works saturdays . late .
i am , the night ' s still young . . it is gon na be a lively one . i am gon na make us a little snack .

please sit down . i told your wife . i am sorry that we have to meet out here . i have got a case coming in two days in the superior court and my office is a mess of papers .
i mean , whatever else anything is , it ought to begin by being personal . <continued_utterance> my head ' s starting to get funny . i have to go back to bed .

i want to hear what happened . my brother is a jackass and a damn fool . the both of you have been as scarce as hen ' s teeth .
you do not have any inner demons . what you have is inner _unk , inner debris -- garbage , loose wires , horseshit in staggering amounts .

kill the man , kill the pipeline .
i hear a beat . how sweet . just to register emotion <person> -- devotion -- and really feel the part , i could stay young and chipper , and i would lock it with a zipper , if i only had a heart . .

oh , that is very kind of you -- but this could never be like <person> . <person> must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now . oh , <person> , what am i going to do .
i just want to let you know mr . <person> i read all about you at nyu business , and i think you are an incredible genius and i have always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you .
consider me your fairy godfather , except without the fairy part . no more _unk apples and bruised bananas , ever , for the rest of your lives .

<person> . well , see , it is not really up to me . it is not my car . <person> , we will have to ask my friend , but she will probably say no . she is a little uptight .
instead of the north pole , he lives in spain . and instead of elves he is got an _unk named <person> . basically he is like your santa , only scarier .
the owl is a messenger . when one shows itself to a sioux . it means someone ' s gon na die . the owl told him about <person> .
mr . so- my employer has made up his mind . he does not change it .
certainly . <continued_utterance> you can understand how a man could go off like that . i mean , a big , faceless organization like yours , coming in with their _unk thugs and stealing private property . <continued_utterance> . is how he described it .
ok -- but -- i am sure i do not have to say this , but i am not kidding , man : <person> ' t -- tell -- your -- mother .

of course he is busy , and so am i . five minutes . that is all i am asking . i know that if he could only hear what i have to say . it would change his life .
as if you care . i saved your life , <person> . those guys woulda killed us . you wan na give your baby to them . .
just on paper . <continued_utterance> <person> is to be removed from the city council race . the means and methods _unk to that end i will entrust to you .

everything i have done in my life has been safe and practical , and where is that gotten me . well , here is to who knows what .
well , i would need the famous <person> charm , not that you would have to do anything you have not done already .
i will be frank with you . this was his mother ' s idea . a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me .
<person> , <person> . i just cannot believe you would block something like that out . <person> was at harvard with us . you turned him in for cheating .
you donandiacute ; t understand .

who do you think did it .
i never wanted the throne . i only wanted to be your equal . now fight me . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> .
as soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway . we are not that far . we can make it .

no , i do not want to take you for a ride . what i want is for . hey , you do not think you can get $ <number> from your parents , could you . from off camera we hear toby .
you are hoping to get into the biz and you have never played one of my games . you have never played any game . that means you have no idea
that is it . i mean , you do not want to order room service or anything . we could play games and watch movies and stuff .
if that were true , this would be one seriously constipated town . most guys in xenia have been looking at naked girls in `` heaven ' ' since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress .
i will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers , lead you into his chambers , and let you slay him where he lies . i will keep the throne , and you will have the casket .
<person> , honey . this will all be over soon . we will be together again . you will forget <person> and i will not be afraid of you . let me get you a cold towel .
' <person> , <person> . i do not want to lose you . and for some reason i get the feelin ' you are about to split . permanently .
got ta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one , or close enough . <person> na take time .
they are getting their weapons from the russians , but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons . i cannot help thinking . the person close to king , the one who switched that pin .
well i hope so . you have your hands full over there . and now taking care of that old man too . that sounds like a lot , <person> .
i found you in the road . <person> . like an unwanted kitten . <person>o you have a name or shall i make one up for you .
it tells me what every face tells me . everybody has a past , they have a pain , and they have something they want .
it is not what you think , <person> .
there is no catch . i put together a tournament with an elite field and a _unk dollar purse , and i am tired of seeing all the money head out of town .
my husband the hero . <continued_utterance> i will be right there , honey . just a minute . <continued_utterance> just a second . <continued_utterance> <person> birthday , <person> .

this is my mother and father . they were very special to me . <person> sunday morning i drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on their grave . i think people should know that .
she is not alone . she is . <person> . oh god . he is gone nuts . he killed <person> and <person> . it is all .
oh , on the contrary , the <person> is considered a very good omen . it is said they _unk the spirits of sailors passed on . it is very bad luck if you kill one . and dolphins too .
<person> ' t make me feel bad for you .
i peeked . <continued_utterance> it really had the _unk , <person> . there was a lot to admire . i have . never read anything quite like it .
<person> , do you remember <person> .
and there are things we will continue to investigate . but there are so many others who have not been able to benefit _unk from plastic surgery as you have --
. and make sure i do not lose everything i have in here .
my honor , that is what i am fighting over . now get up off the ground , or do i have to whoop you where you lie . jenny comes running up the street .
thelma . i am not gon na talk about this . now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will . you understand .
you are kidding . that son-of-a- bitch .
you are going to love this war , russell . there is good guys , bad guys , cheap shrimp . and <person> is still singing in the background . i missed you .
<person> . playing in a pool all day long . _unk his birthright on a group of _unk strangers . i consider this your fault , <person> .
<person> , well , i thought i would start by laying all the cards on the table , so maybe you can understand why i am _unk in turning <person> over to <person> .
what does it mean .
<person> is dead . <person> . <person> is not quite sure he understood .
agent mulder -- we both know that if you and <person> had not taken the initiative to search the adjacent building , you could have multiplied the _unk by a hundred --
maybe it is because i am getting an apartment nicer than anything you will ever see in your life . <continued_utterance> i cannot believe the old man kept his promise .
this is all your land .
land . are you crazy . i am no _unk and i am no farmer . i am a cop . that is what i know and that is what i do .

it was just like before , was not it . was not it . but you are making progress . instead of killing seven people to get the one you are after , this time there was only one other person involved .
real magic , <person> , is simply the art of controlling the reality of others . you lack faith in your- self . you must learn to trust your intuition . <continued_utterance> go in the direction the bird is flying .
you know . i have a feeling he is around here somewhere . and if he cares about you . if he wants to see your lovely face again . he should show up before it is too late .

your answer to my question . it is one thing to have never been injured in your life , but to state that you have never taken ill , well that is a whole new level .
<person> , i know you do not like flattery but if anybody i know is going to win a nobel prize , it is you . you got ta be thinking about your next book so i know you will find this case particularly interesting .
<person> do not mind . he likes i read his mail . saves him the time . plus a lot of folks around here cannot read , so it is more a public service , really .

i do not want courage . i do not want to be a warrior . all i have ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you .
she must think i am such a nothing , such a loser . a lousy driving range pro living in a winnebago , making five bucks an hour plus lessons .
<person> as well hear him out . <person>s , what choice we got . but no matter what happens , see it through to the end . if you do not i will curse the day i ever laid eyes on you .

it is a lot of world for one man . you sure that is not wishful thinking , you wishing
you do not get it , _unk . the idea was : we were ripping you off . suddenly a car alarm _unk from outside . <person> ' s out the door in a flash . the others follow .
<person> , honey , we have been over this . you as a father . think about it . <continued_utterance> you know i actually have considered naming him `` <person> ' ' .

my man . you told <person> you would <person> those men . do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man . you are just a dirty little _unk .
then the next time she _unk , walk right up to her and spit in her eye . that is what i would do .
so what does he want .
keep him on that . he had excellent ratings as an evidence teacher and i trust him more than you . <person> . <person> everything on that effort and i want him apprehended <person> , not killed .
i do not want to talk about it . <person> ' s get to work . <continued_utterance> there must be something to do . there is always something to do .
<person> , im hangin up this phone now .
<person> ' t matter . i like change . you know , constant turnover . as soon as i close the deal , it is one of two more times , then adios .
what about him . we . we have to do something . <continued_utterance> we cannot just leave him . he will run back to his outfit , report our position .
you have come far . you are a good man . i love you .
i am a doctor . <person> ' s not _unk each other . not all rich kids are _unk , and not all psychologists care about dreams . the question is how you
the <person> boy saw him , <person> . i will make it , but <person> and the homicide department off my back or they will blow the whole thing .
this is the one . my glasses are in my room . i would like to read it by myself , but i am a little anxious . read it , son . slowly .
<person> . when i fill out my <number> , do i say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation .
_unk strategy : i send <person> and rock to any event where there is cameras -- <person> gets _unk ' - honor treatment everywhere with that shape a ' her ' s .
that is what i thought until you came riding in . i saw your car over at the gas station . it is a cool car . want to take me for a ride . <person> ' s kind of lonely this time of day .
we leave them in the shell .
if i am going to order , at least i ought to be content with my food .
you know what i would like to see . meat in a cone . you could put corned beef hash in a cone , or chopped liver .
<person> advice for a shopkeeper . let alone a king .
it has not changed . it is died .
just because you are nervous about tomorrow , <person> , does not give you the right to get snippy . if you cannot handle the pressure , postpone the interview .
my bike . it is back over there . we will hang soon . bring your mask if you want . i am getting used to it .
i am buying milk . i just thought i would say hello . <continued_utterance> look , i know it is probably too late , but is there any way you can come out for a little while .
no , you cannot . <person> , you are scaring him , dad . you are scaring him . he . <continued_utterance> he cannot take a plow .
while you wait and be patient , the nine realms laugh at us . the old ways are done . you would stand giving speeches while <person> falls .
no , no , it is <person> ' s , i mean it is not <person> ' s , it is . someone loaned it to us , i mean someone .
oh _unk wanted it too , he felt horrible about what happened . he really does like you <person> . but it is hard for him . he is under a lot of pressure . he does more than people realize holding things together .
no you are not . - you have been behaving oddly for over a month now . i am not leaving until you tell me what is on your mind .
i will tell you who you are . you are the glue . you are the thing that holds everybody around you together . you are strong , you listen and you see things in people the rest of us cannot . it is a gift .
people who do not go into our courts when they are told to sometimes go directly into our jail . <continued_utterance> look , i am genuinely sorry .
she did that after you let her dump you . it would not kill you just once to tell her she is beautiful , she can dance , she is
i am sorry . professor tripp . maybe it is seeing that jacket that belonged to her . it just looks . really lonely . hanging there . in a closet . maybe i am just a little sad .
well , i do not know where <person> intends to stick you . that is his problem . maybe in his room . but i am warning you , mrs .
i mean . i just think . i do not know : we had a great little fling . you know . let us not push it . i mean , is that ok . i just --
well , yeah , they do . but there is definitely peeling involved too . i saw it on discovery health . if more people knew about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the knife .
that was not nerves , brother . it was the rage of battle . how else could i have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive .
i did not learn <person> because we were getting shipped here . you do not learn it in a couple of weeks . i studied it in high school .
thanks , iandiacute ; ll pay you back .

oh liz . we . god . we , in vegas . <person> crushed her skull . she was dead . there was nothing else to do . it was an accident .
we had a lot of arguments .
mr . <person> had me come up and fetch this right after he brung it to asheville . `` <person> , he said , `` take this home and fix it up for mr .
i see the good doctor gave you glowing _unk . ' exceptional stamina ' .

i am not bad , i am just drawn that way .
i snuck back to my car , trying to convince myself it never happened . and when i woke up in the hospital . somehow it had not . <person> now .
<person> ' s walkie-talkie . it is probably upstairs . find it . call the ranger base . my gun . see if you can find our stuff . my gun ' s in my backpack , side pocket .
there is a ground breaking book that just came out , <person> . not everything in it applies to you but when you see the title , i think you will see that it can help .
the papers are going to eat you alive . even if you beat it , you will never get another commission . they want someone to be accountable .
it is no arsonist ' s <person> , but i guess you know that . it is a young man ' s book . it got me remembering how it felt to be young .
we neutralized anybody with a voice . <person> , <person> . <person> . anyone who was standing in the way of the land . is that it .
according to jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . they must be buried together or their souls will not rest in peace .
he cannot find you . as soon as we stop - before we stop - we will jump off and i will take you to a hotel in town .
we are . we go to the police . we tell them the truth . now . before they find out . now . we save ourselves .
this whole worlds wild at heart and weird on top . <continued_utterance> i wish you really , truly loved me . i wish youd sing me <person> . i wish i was somewhere over that rainbow . <person> . <person> , shit , shit .
you have never threatened me before . <continued_utterance> all right . i am not going to print anything until i have another source . but i promise you , i will get one .
you aint gon na begin worryin about whats bad for you at this hour , are you , sugar . i mean , here you are crossin state lines with a a- number one certified murderer .
will you stop eating the eggs for a minute . how can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs . . what does this mean , <person> .
i do not know what to do .
she threw up in her mask , yes . but she had not eaten one hour prior to admission .
he aint never known me , <person> , so there aint much for him to forget . not seein each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us , too .
you can see the outline of a butt . as grady nods , <person> holds out the donut box . <person> want one . they are incredible . incredible .
i aint that dumb , mama . <person> and i been on a crime spree . knockin off convenience stores all across the south . aint you read about it .
she must be exhausted from trying to be witty for you all night long .
andlt ; andlt ; you will be alright . he is from the f . b . i . he is here to help you . he wants to know what happened in the harbor . andgt ; andgt ;
who do we interface with on their side .
it is not the gun . <person> ' t you understand . it is you . what you stand for . that is not for <person> . <person> looks at her _unk . <continued_utterance> please , it has nothing to do with you personally .
we are being blamed for these deaths . scully , i want to know what this man died of . <person> ' t you .
you do not know that . if it is your belief that gives her form , then you have got to shut her out . somehow you have to break the connection .
you jerk . you should have said she was terrible , sick as hell . practically on death ' s door . what a jerk , what a pain in the ass you can be sometimes .
look , i know it is hard to believe .
<person> . _unk a dozen roses tomorrow morning please , <person> . i tell you what , send her a _unk . i am sorry , but you will have to stay . no vacations till this thing is cleared .
well . we needed the money . it is not like i killed anybody , for <person> ' s sake . <continued_utterance> i am sorry . well , we need the money . now we have it .
<person> , but the country did not even exist as a country yet . it was a mess , and he did not have a leg to stand on .
<person> to me , fella .
neither does he . that is where he loses . this man ' s scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .
i do not have a wife . well , i do - but not a real wife . <person> . look . someone else sent that note . someone who --
what is <person> , speak <person> , speak <person> .
only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night , thelma . who is gon na believe that . . we just do not live in that kind of world . <person> over .
then you better get in the water , before you get burned . <continued_utterance> you and me , finally . this will be so fantastic , <person> . trust me .
no . no . <person> ' t leave . <person> ' t leave . you have got ta help us , please . you do not know what it is like over here .
well , first of all , you cannot do anything with a bull without the bull hook . <continued_utterance> it is the only way to train them . <person> .
you got to be more careful . hands is important . let me show you something . when i was a kid , now i do not know if you can still see it , but i _unk my fingers in a _unk .
nah , she asked the wrong question .
thanks . god , i hope they are not screwed up . i might have to bag the whole semester . <person> , sorry to bother you .
pulling files is another thing .
i am not sure yet , but i am starting to believe that everything happens for a reason . <person> , why did i eat the forbidden fruit .
<person> is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you _unk ' and turnin ' . it is when you wish the sun was _unk ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you are afraid of .
<person> , drag him in here . if you be nice , i will take you to disneyland . <person> , <person> and <person> put the suitcases down .
no point . two eye witnesses saw him near the dumpster where they found the legs . she _unk her _unk wrists . <continued_utterance> you gon na eat before you leave .
i am not worried in the least , <person> . i am sure your entire staff will _unk . with intensive treatment he should be out in about -- fifty years .
what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here .
i thought you saw him . i was amazed , he does a _unk . i tell you if i was a girl i would be impressed .
that is just what things came to . sometimes you cannot help that . it does not change me respecting you . and now you let me down . i expected more from you , you know . i really did . i expected you to --
they have been taken care of .
what are you talkin ' about .
<person> . <continued_utterance> now what is this big deal you wanted to discuss . i should not even talk to you after canceling out on my show .
. absolutely not .
oh , yes . it is come over all the media now . you have never been more famous . your face is everywhere , which of course just . makes it worse . i .
he is only just dead . what was i supposed to do with him . i cannot take him away anywhere . and nobody wants to take him for me . do you .
i am opening the _unk and the menagerie this afternoon for some extra cash before the show tomorrow night . we will see how she does with the crowd . she got any skills .
you are right . our characters are obviously supposed to jump on each other . probably to create emotional tension when danger happens . no use fighting it .
<person> . but i do know one thing : you are exactly like him . my father was born wanting only one thing : to be president .
what is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules . _unk have this bad boy complex -- -- she kisses him fiercely on the lips .
ah , i had a tough day . some jerk d . k ' d me and i got ta cover his loss .
and if it does not . by cooperating now we are but beggars to our demise . our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all .
would you please .
why , of course i will .
keep the ring . it looks better on you anyways .
argentina . <person> , youre outta your mind . now you just tell me where you are and <person> come for you . i wont say nothin to the police about <person> , i promise . he can do what he wants , i dont care .
always lookin ' on the bright side , are not ya .
thought you would feel that way , <person> . you were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma . . we will do you last . <continued_utterance> <person> . .
you really do not want to know any more than that , mr . <person> . <person> ' s just say i have some friends .
as not our way . we go all on one , one on all . fight one of us , you fight us all . that is the cowboy way .
oh , is that so . no offense , lady , but i am not so sure i like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down .
hey . you did not let me finish . as soon as i get in there i am going to talk to somebody and get you invited , okay .
in the leg .
the bedroom , <person> , thank you . <continued_utterance> <person> , this young man appears quite competent . would you ask him if he would like to stay on as my valet .
guess who she asked to hold the knife . guess why she brought me in on this kidnap thing . it was her way a ' buying it back-
we woke up the next morning and <person> was gone . he could not handle the idea of slumming for soze . he left a note wishing us good luck and took a chunk of the money we would scraped together .
okay , you win . now try to get some sleep , huh .
<person> ' t you remember . you brought action against him for stealing your _unk notes and they booted him . the only place that would take him after that was university of _unk .
i suggested we go to the police , but you did not like that ; so , frankly , <person> , i am all out of ideas .
not if you are with him every step of the way .
actually , i saw the greenhouse . so i thought . i thought i would come out here and take a look at it . you do not see one of those every day . it looks like heaven .
that is weird . i talked to your brother jimmy five or six times . ted is devastated to hear this . mary by the way , how is he doing .
oh -- <person> , <person> . you know , i know it is not right , but i am going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage .
you are a real drag , y ' know . <person> was gon na be my big night . now i bet it is gon na be <person> ' s big night .
scrub my back , will ya , nora .
and you must be <person> . <person> , darling , _unk <person> . the deadliest _unk since <person> , they say . what do you think , darling . should i hate him .
i will not . but then i get to meet someone new . that is the easy part .
you do . well , you are lucky . you be sweet to ' em . especially your wife . my husband was not sweet to me and look how i turned out . now go on , get in there . <continued_utterance> air holes .
there is only one problem , <person> . we do not know his real name . we just made it up . in fact , we made the whole guy up .
it sounds wild . so now you are a big hero , right . for fixing their system .
so birdie wins it . <continued_utterance> you or me , <person> . <continued_utterance> he is laying up . <person> to tie , eagle to win , and that gutless wonder ' s laying up .
<person> was an evil _unk . <continued_utterance> . born with ruthless bones . and if he really is dead and gone , this game `bout to explode .
i am not sure of the name ' s origin . they are the two paths we regularly patrol . something happens and you are on one of the other trails , it might be awhile before we find you .
yeah . yeah . i guess so . that kinda _unk get us a long way down that yellow brick road . <continued_utterance> . but damn man . this better go smooth .
i followed you to the maroon studios . when i heard those shots , i thought i would help you and investigate the inside of this trunk .
i will try and remember that .
it is business , <person> . it is not personal . how about we go get so much candy you will be bouncing off the walls for days .
i do not know . my friends think i am too picky . i think i am just a weirdo magnet . i did come close once -- just last year , in fact . there was this guy he lived in san francisco .
oh , this is not my car . it is down a ways . i should have parked closer . i just did not think it would be so heavy . i could drive up .
a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you . iandiacute ; m not sure why , but until we find out , i must ask you to stay .
so there is no border , no customs . they can just drive anywhere they want . . . there is nothing to stop them . . .
there is a responsibility that you have got to have . it is a long way from high school , <person> .
ah . he was hurt bad . <person> nicked an artery . i do not know . an hour . hour and a half . <continued_utterance> what the hell you looking at me like that for .
yes , i told you before , there are people who owe you money but they are not paying . there is too much heat on <person> .
but why is it my fault . i am telling you , i did not , i did not _unk . i did not . i did not feel any surging .
i know if he could have it back somehow , he would not do it differently or have it any other way . he would not . he loved his job .
if you are so innocent , why ' d you run .
<person> . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado . yes sir .
mcmanus has a friend in the fourteenth precinct . they are coming out for one job - thursday . they are picking up a guy smuggling _unk out of south america . <person> and mcmanus have a fence set to take the stuff .
. and he assigned me to find out who the man is . <continued_utterance> we all know the _unk are going to win , do not we .
' fuck . ' ' shit . ' these are highly technical golf terms and you are using them on your first lesson -- this is promising .
this narrow defeat was probably due in large part to the surprising _unk minute _unk by senator scott _unk ; _unk ; <person> , who until today provided the _unk voice in the cry for mutant registration . earlier today , <person> had this to say :
i do not know , yet . what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale , not _unk . whatever it is , he is not finished .
<person> at the end of the day is the same thing as a coup . a puppet <person> , and a _unk soviet government pulling the strings . no deal . and the missiles are almost operational .
i work with retards .
airborne . that is where they used to get us agents from . now we get ' em from _unk , ivy league . accountants and computer _unk . yuppies with guns . that is scary shit .
her entire testimony must be stricken from the record . you should not have heard it , but you did . now , that was my mistake . and you must strike it from your minds , give it no weight .
i did not believe the lawyer or the bank . my mother worked . they had savings . we were never broke . so why would they need a mortgage . and then it hit me .
i know , <person> , and i have been longing for you so . but we will just have to find another way . the car is already packed . <continued_utterance> <person> twisp , i will not allow you to accept defeat so easily .
this is your moment , do not you see . the instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again . when you stand up and are counted .
i am going to have you disbarred . i am going to have your ticket . you know what you did . do you know what you did .
there was a young fellow over at _unk ' s today when it got hit . way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers .
<person> , i am worried that your game will wipe me off the face of the earth . i am thinking i was right never to have a bioport installed .
come after me . time traveller i did it to save your life , young lady , which i am afraid does not hold much meaning for you or anyone else . the girl it does not .
well , i had a conversation with <person> , so . maybe i will go with him . <person> is gon na need a new partner because <person> is going into used cars .
<person> and <person> do not think so .
what can i tell you . it is a healthier lifestyle down here , and it is easier to succeed when your head ' s clear . those guys i worked with back in boston , they were a bad influence .
you know you do not have to sneak . you could stay with me . i know things , <person> . sweet things . i could make you so happy .
japan . what is she doing in japan .
<person> , but he was with <person> at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with <person> and then with <person> . and since i stole <person> away from him . are you following this .
that can be arranged . in the meantime we are leaving the piece of shit in the driveway . with a note .
anything you want .
im sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd , but i want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl .
see here , this is queens . all the way round here , australia . you cannot get any further away before you start coming back . y ' know , there ' re still places in australia where no human being has ever set foot .
no matter what the british government says , i will not kill this story . <person> will show both of you to the elevator . and one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later .
you are not exactly `` going anywhere ' ' yourself .
i want a black one . a little black brother . that is a big problem it seems to me . lack of racial integration . that is a big one . you think . <person> looks up to . <continued_utterance> what do you think .
ms . <person> , did <person> rape you in your family ' s home on the <number> rd of april last year . suzie glances at sam , hesitates . <continued_utterance> ms . <person> .
so do i , man .
i think she is been _unk ' with <person> . got pipes like <person> but she is a junk fiend : caught her _unk in the ladies room a month back .
_unk he know what we look like . he seen our photo .
<person> , <person> , -- you take the south entrance . <person> and i will go in here . <person> and <person> start for the south entrance . cyclops iandiacute ; ll see you both soon .
<person> , it could not be that . <continued_utterance> i mean , i agree , it is very important to have . <continued_utterance> . the right car . <continued_utterance> . to take you where you want to go . <number> hours a day .
what are you doing . it is over . <continued_utterance> it is over , <person> . c ' mon . we do not have to do this .
i am still that guy . i am still that guy . <person> speaks with _unk conviction , as if she might change her mind if she thought about it too much .
our home city , of course . but i should start with you . would you like some moonshine . <continued_utterance> then what would you like .
<person> con <person> .
i have changed my mind again . what is <person> like this time of year . . i have never been to <person> . or let us just see where the road takes us . <continued_utterance> i think i would like a little company .
the main problem is , <person> , these people are extremely _unk of outsiders , _unk . relations have not been amicable .
the package they came for was not the baby , it was dope , drugs , a shitload of dope . we were stopped by some cops down on the street .
fine , if you do not want us , stay with the scum in present management -- dedicated to running you and bluestar into the ground .
they do not particularly . that was my idea . this assignment was boring me to death . the personality they gave you was not too thrilling .
why , sure you can , <person> . you can get me out of here and then i will get that rocket off you , and we will make a break for <person> ' s house .
<person> ' t give up on me now , <person> .
if i could do you think i would be standing here wasting my time . can you fix it , or do i have to go somewhere else .
. but because i am a just man , i have decided to give mr . <person> what he deserves . <continued_utterance> mr . <person> will escort you to the plane .
i just had a breakthrough , and i have to thank you for it . for the first time in my life , when confronted with a horrible , insensitive person i actually knew what i wanted to say and i said it .
the captain was the only one here at this hour . look from junior and _unk to the window behind him -- <person> _unk our way . to _unk , _unk :
it is the feeling of this commission that these _unk are severe _unk of the home improvement laws , and therefore constitute _unk of the license to sell aluminum siding as approved by this state .
no . <person> was a battered wife and <person> was a _unk whore . if that is not motive , what is . you want answers then we brace those two hard .
i think they shoot right outta its mouth , hook you , and pull you right in . <person> thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else .
him who . <person> .
thanks , <person> .
sometimes we have to improvise . <continued_utterance> <person> . my <person> . what is happened .
after the interview we will take a celebration sail around lake , then friday -- my birthday -- we will have wonderful meal at _unk ' s . <continued_utterance> <person> , are you going to spend all summer driving us crazy with that .
they were digging near here and they found some very pretty vases . they also found this . i think we ignore the old ways at our peril , do not you .
i want to dance now .
ill slap those eyes right outta your head . <continued_utterance> <person> , baby . _unk the first time you done it with a girl who was not _unk .
forget it . burn it , s ' not important now .
am i happy . i do not know . <person> the next man , i guess . i do not laugh all day long like an idiot , if that is what you mean .
what are you talking about .
we are going to follow the rules of engagement . the rules of engagement which the president has approved and signed in his order of october <number> rd . <continued_utterance> yes , captain , you may proceed . clear your guns .
no . last night i could not sleep , so i just laid there looking up at the sky , counting the stars . there were over seventy . <person> makes you think , does not it .
someone wants to kill me , i would rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here . looking for a woman a little more your type . how about that one .
oh , jeez .
i am oz , the great and <person> . <continued_utterance> who are you . <continued_utterance> who are you .
leave me be for a minute . mama gets all insane and then i see you _unk your individuality and personal freedom with some _unk tramp . how you figure im gon na feel .
<person> is why i think in the calm cold light of day , we should both think real hard about whether or not you really want to continue on here at merchants national trust .
whether you thought this was for real or not , you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character .
because no matter how much you claim to `` love ' ' me , you could never have a frost giant sitting on the throne of <person> .
i am losing my patience .
you are the highest law enforcement official in the country . use the fucking army if you need to .
a bioport , now , that is a sort of a hole in your spine , is not it . lotta assholes `round here , but that is generally it . i do not know why you would be talking to me about that , lady .
how is it going . i just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls , and believe me , he was very thorough , if you know what i mean . how is it going with you .
some bone fragments came up in the _unk this morning . we thought there would been another _unk , but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town .
big game fishing . <person> torpedoes . retirement gift from his friends at the cia . <continued_utterance> in the meantime , perhaps this will spark your interest . <person> lighter . thumb here , press here -
am i trying to _unk my responsibility . that is not the way i see it . it was a fluke , a crazy thing that happened , but i stand behind my honor on this .
banal love songs it is . hey , you wan na try something .
-- there is this one kid , we call him <person> on account of he is a _unk . he got out of his cage once and --
i am <person> . <continued_utterance> i see you both have been rejected by the socially elite of our school . <person> is a cultural _unk compared to india . though some of the girls are very attractive .
just give her some of <person> ' s money and send her home . he is not gon na miss it . he is in happy land .
if this is in any way designed to delay the testimony of <person> . <continued_utterance> we will recess until <number> : <number> am monday morning . and i will see counsel in chambers .
he as not nothing like me . how come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart . you ought to stop protecting him .
oh yeah , that would make golf real fun -- the guy does not even drink beer or gamble . now <person> smiles . mary get over here .
no one ' s going to kill you if [ you do what you are told . ] we are visiting e . i . o . for some new tests . now get in , or do we start playing rough .
things change so fast here . you leave for a millennium , and it is like the whole neighborhood ' s gone . <continued_utterance> perhaps we should split up .
has anybody asked his wife . she is the one i hope did it .
all right , let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth .
that is what this is all about . tell me , who is gon na use your lousy freeway . we got the red cars , the best public transportation in the country .
i promise you that field will be plowed . we will plant it with _unk . and the money will be yours when harvest comes . mrs . <person> _unk , desperate .
i was right about you . you are going blow us all up . <person> got home tonight before you and <person> . people are talking . <continued_utterance> i should not be a clown . i should be a goddamn fortune teller .
what is up .
god , he could be the next person to talk into the store . he could be . <person> . george pappas , in his twenties , one of <person> ' s
somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . you have done your job , x , head back to <person> . i will be landing in <number> minutes . this is my operation now .
no , you are not . i do not trust any of you .
but i did . he was a great man , a leader of the church . and his example inspired me to dedicate my life to <person> ' s service .
you have got this wrong . you are not under arrest , you have been abducted . and until i say different , you belong to me .
yes , darling .
no , are you crazy . and i do not want him ever to know . do you understand . . <continued_utterance> i want to ask you a big favor , <person> . please drop the bluestar deal .
you _unk bastard . . you son of a bitch . . you cannot do this . . . you cannot do this . . . god damn you . . god damn you . .
you and i are the same , <person> . we are smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love . a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .
but i really do not think that i want action . me , i mean . the bearer of the excited bioport . what i want is . not now . not here . i feel too . too exposed .
well , i am not on drugs . but i might be crazy . <continued_utterance> oh my god , <person> . . . i cannot believe it . i just really cannot believe it . i mean . whoa .
maybe afterwards . <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> . i cannot believe this . i trusted you and you blew my pod . you must have _unk _unk .
because this _unk criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what i am capable of . and what i am not . and better than anyone else , i am capable of stopping <person> <number> . <number> .
well , whatever the hell happened it is just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place .
my name ' s <person> . and furthermore , you came back to see me tonight .
go home . <person> cleaned up . <person> to work . <person> is heading down to mexico city next week and i am not getting left behind . <person> ' t fuck this up .
wheels within wheels , eh . well , live it up , <person> . <person> , drink and be merry -- is that why you are leaving for new york .
and that is the queen ' s south <person> . every man who fought in the boer war got one of those . but this . <continued_utterance> that is the distinguished conduct medal .
thanks , but i am here on business . i heard you are the g around here . i am looking for some cars , expensive ones . a lot of them .
then all we can do is stay mobile and alert . he is got to make a move sometime , and we have got to be ready when he does . welcome to police work . you better like coffee .
but the _unk on your back ' s never been quite so big . if you need a new line of work , i got this _unk leading man needs _unk <continued_utterance> his agent told me he could play straight .
that is what i love about <person> . he can talk himself into anything . <continued_utterance> oh sorry , <person> , i forgot all about you . you can go now . just leave the shotgun .
then it is <number> dollars of shit . <continued_utterance> go ahead . take a swing .
<person> ' s gone . <person> that may or may not be his leads out to the garage . two guard dogs shot dead but no other signs of a struggle .
why are you running off so fast here .
<person> ' t bother the poor boy . it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are .
the air is not toxic . <continued_utterance> how dare you open a spaceman ' s helmet on an uncharted planet . my eyeballs could have been sucked from their sockets .
i was down the street .
so if you are not treating him while he is here , then he is not a patient while he is here , is he . and i have the right to see him .
i am here , as not i .
four cases in three years .
<person> . your secret weapon right . i mean , i know j . <person> is a _unk fuck , but _unk _unk fags ' do not make the best major case witnesses . i am worried those burning _unk may have damaged his credibility .
you guess . my parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt <person> .
<person> pretty rough .
that i could not . say . let me ask you something : was she a little <continued_utterance> well she must have packed on a few pounds over the years .
kinda looks like you .
you could grace our hallowed halls again , if , while you are here , you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
<person> , well , just remember , it is the palace that pays you , not the people .
ah , i see . a purely . _unk relationship . <continued_utterance> really <person> , could not you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears .
well , now , maybe you will not have to .
let me tell you , i have seen a lot of _unk on this road .
just the parts you wish i did not . the place in _unk canyon where your going to hole up for the kidnapping thing . is it safe . <continued_utterance> get your coat .
<person> , <person> . i probly aint precisely got all the facts straight , but its about what they said .
exactly . the trick is , you got ta pick your target . they have to be nice little housewife types . _unk . but , i am telling you , you get their pilot lit , these babes , they can _unk start a _unk .
bury her out in the desert .
i will have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days .
i can understand if you are thinkin ' about it . i mean , in a way , you have got something to go back for . i mean <person> and everything .
he said he was the brain trust . said he was smarter than all of us . he started reading `` <person> , ' ' staring at himself in the mirror .
couple grand or _unk give you two a leg up . get you to the west coast , mexico , most anyplace , with a few dollars in your jeans . i got it figured good , sailor .
nothing , dear . <person> luck . <person> , i have a little extra cash -- why do not we go somewhere fancy and celebrate -- y ' know , kinda get
i do not know , but `` it is the reason i am living here and you are just passing through . `` now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars .
you can work out of the east coast . we will get a place on long island and burn our suitcases .
i am used to spending a lot of time alone . i guess that is what i thought it would be out here . but , it is not is it .
what is this about . this is obviously some scam . is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment .
what if they put us out of business .
i really do have to go .
shhhh . she has no idea , but she thinks the window display is lovely . <person> night _unk . birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag , goes out the door .
i cannot think of anyone i would rather lie here with . <continued_utterance> <person> maybe <person> . if <person> were here , what do you suppose he would do to me .
no . he stopped by himself . <person> . that is all . let me go . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t touch me . <person> ' s hands fall to her sides . <person> heads for the door .
well , i asked the _unk on the corner . he did not know . then i asked a janitor , the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way . he was very helpful .
you might say we had a meeting of the minds , yes .
yes . i used to be so afraid of everything , it was like dying a thousand deaths a day . now , that you showed me i have only one death to be afraid of , i am not afraid of anything anymore .
she had it , before she drank herself to death . <person> ' t exactly a love child .
mr . <person> . we are running kind of late . how about if <person> goes on to the _unk . you could give me a ride when you find the ticket .
we all got a secret side , baby . hope you dont think i been lyin to you bout other things , sugar .
there are four _unk in the works . three to the black sea , shipping out through the _unk . all vulnerable to unstable governments or russian blockade .
<person> . i was an agent -- i am not now -- just tell me who i am . how did we know each other . why are they trying to kill me . .
and you would carry water for elephants . ha , ha . you have any idea how much water an elephant drinks , kid . college . <person> . <person> met a college man yet who knew his own ass from _unk .
am i . where is <person> . you cannot file murder charges without a corpse . who knows this . cops know this- you would know this .
i tried to warn you in the bar . i told you to exercise control , that it all depended on your mind . all of this , everything is your creation . and we are now heading toward your true moment , of choice .
<person> . <person> , get <person> on the box . i want him to look at it . and tell <person> at _unk , _unk . so sport , the falcon has heard the _unk . tell me more .
hawaii . i have read all about it . i have dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet . oh , <person> . i would kill to go there .
yup . there are a couple more falls in the park , but none quite so . inviting as this one . now do not take my word for it , you can see for yourself . how long ' s your stay .
have you completely lost your mind . so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you do not think at some point somebody might notice that she is gone .
i do not care if there is a lump of coal in here . i just want to be able to rub <person> ' face in it when i crack this thing . <person> watches <person> work the box for a beat .
i cannot do it , <person> . not when we are so close . i cannot let you ruin everything .
i am in a slump .
half the people i knew named their babies after him .
why should not he hear me . <person> ' t you get it , he is a sick person . a _unk mess . he faked suicide .
that sounds nice -- for you .
you are going to be hungover for three days . like those guys on `` oprah ' ' that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them .
it means you do not talk to anybody . you do not draw attention to yourself in any way . do you understand that . <continued_utterance> tell me you understand that .
<person> , look at me . you have got a concussion and you are on a moving train . there is nothing you can do . <person> can handle him . she is done it for years .
<person> ' t you worry , young man . i will get right on this . <person> ' t worry . we will light a fire under that deadbeat .
you have kept up your end of the bargain , i will do the same . but you really should consider staying on , you make a decent agent .
you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , <person> .
<person> wanted to see for myself . they are burning their documents . <continued_utterance> they think we are going to war . g-d help us , <person> .
<person> will not cut it . <continued_utterance> survival means discipline and assimilation . there are no special cases here . now , get going . get up there . <continued_utterance> what are you blubbering about .
but that is my calling , my purpose , my raison d ' etre . <person>s are supposed to make people laugh . and believe me , those people needed a laugh .
<person> , that ozone layer is _unk . <person> to me the government could do somethin about it . one of these mornings the _unk come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an x-ray .
_unk knows i am a _unk . what are you proving . <person> ' s the guy _unk you right now . the guy who is vulnerable right now .
_unk , what are you talkin ' about .
no . no fucking way . that is too creepy .
you are a good one to give advice . you are sitting on the steps , locked out of your house because you cannot pay your taxes , and you are going to give me advice on life .
i think she is acting . i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her . i think maybe she is upset that he did not .
' cuz it is the only way you can beat <person> . ' cuz you never got over that he is on tour and you are not . ' cuz you get that look on your face .
you really do not get it , do you . i am genetically programmed to desire a big , buff , manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring . it is , like , a caveman thing .
i have endured a five million dollar beating for nothing . <continued_utterance> i have been stabbed . stabbed in the back . <continued_utterance> i do not have a friend within a hundred miles . this is a _unk thought if you think about it .
it is pushing it , bb . what time would your husband be home , ' cos he would have to go over the figures with the salesman . that is if there is a salesman available this evening .
oh , i see . <continued_utterance> <person> , on second thought , i do not think i will wait for her . just give her this when she gets back , okay . and this is for the baby .
pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night . chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope , only to find myself standing right where i am right now : at another dead end --
just what i need in my life right now . i am in a slump and i have got the irs on me . like when something goes wrong , it is like .
because this is not a dry wash . <continued_utterance> it is the little walking river . <continued_utterance> and it was full of water when i drove by here three days ago . full . i mean . a river .
uh , mr . <person> , we took a little loss today . we got stopped out on _unk . . about <number> thousand .
for you to be getting this kind of heat , for what they have on you . it does not add up . <person> ' s got ' em running scared . and i will tell you something else , you rush , you get careless .
that is my fault , not hers . i have got to keep practicing . i am still in the learning stage but magic , madmartigan , requires concentration and --
the way you talk . <person> heard a <person> talk like that .
that is right , <person> . you better be afraid . i told you it was not over , but you did not listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .
you should not ' ve killed mr . <person> . you should not ' ve done that . it was wrong . i am takin ' you both in for it .
<person> was even going to let them kill toto yesterday for biting miss _unk . oh , please , professor , why cannot we go with you and see all the crowned heads of europe .
it will all be over . i will give you the all clear and you can go back to your life . this will be a great adventure you can look back on .
talk what out . we are locked and loaded here . we are _unk . i have got relatives on the airport right now . i have got . <continued_utterance> answer it .
i am just flesh and blood , baby . that and a few memories of bad women ; just like most guys . but you already know that . you read my mind , remember . thanks for the lemonade . <person> turns to leave .
_unk . i figure i owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes .
if anything ever happens to me .
especially in this light . this is the only light they had then , so i like to study it this way . i love this place . i love all ruins .
_unk the man a prize . he would also rat his competition and kill the ones we could not convict . now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip .
there is always a _unk or two during a change in command . the men get a little loose . but i know i am leaving them in good hands .
so charming . so suave . <person> ' t insult me . i am not one of your ' little london girls ' who falls for the lies .
. but they got a good new drug . <person> to the fundamentals , that is how ibm and <person> were built . good things sometimes take time .
i have known <person> since the academy . he was a top pupil . a peculiar little pain in the ass , but very good with details .
i do not know . <person> owes me over twelve hundred bucks . if i had not let him keep my paper route money , i would be okay .
you would have to work out an arrangement with an aluminum siding company and they would have to do the job very quickly for us to make our deadline . we have got a deadline , that is the problem .
<person> , fall semester , first day of class , it was <number> degrees and you were wearing the coat . <person> just blinks , no ready _unk . <continued_utterance> that is why they all give you such a hard time in workshop .
yes , sir . but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division . he has proposed an additional <number> million dollar payment .
well , you are perfect now .
you saving me . you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling .
we cannot stop . i have been noticing some new . glitches . i am not sure what they mean . i am not sure the game is ok .
what is wrong .
how are we going to rescue anybody .
because you have stolen from mr . <person> . that you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are still alive , but he feels you owe him . you will repay your debt .
i doubt it .
oh , c ' mon , i have really got to make a phone call . what do you think i am going to do , pick up one of the new jersey delegates to the i . b . m . convention .
what kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing .
i do not think he will come back here . <continued_utterance> thanks . for all your help . <continued_utterance> i know it was not easy . maybe , someday , i will be able to .
i did not think you would use that _unk on _unk if you were one of them . <continued_utterance> watch them . <continued_utterance> now i will show you what i already know .
he used to come around here . he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the glades . <continued_utterance> got sort of hung up on her , from what hear .
. but <person> , he is looking for two years in tucson . and they called him up and said to come out . he is a good man . he is only trying to do what is right . <continued_utterance> this is my husband .
seriously , it is like we are being reborn . we really could reinvent ourselves here , just like you said . nobody knows about your massive humiliation .
. well , put ' er there , partner . these two _unk are gon na show the world what golf in west texas is all about .
shit . i spent sixty bucks on this gourmet crap you like . <person> ' s cheese and <person> ' s crackers and those stupid little french _unk , i forget what they are _unk
let me earn my keep . i will go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot . <person> to make him some cow tea next time .
that is really useful , thanks .
what is this . you are quitting . first sign of _unk , you are quitting . anyone want to bet me i cannot par in with a seven iron . doc . take the bet .
<number> am . it will be too painful to see <person> again . i shall ask mom if we can cut our vacation short and return to oakland .
then i will go to the press . i will tell the entire story to the new york times .
you do not know anything about me or what i have gone through .
what the hell happened .
no doubt . i do not think anyone got a wink last night with all that racket . <continued_utterance> i thought there were laws in this city against _unk _unk . or are they just another big policeman ' s joke .
excuse me sir .
that is okay , <person> . you are doing fine . but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you .
i - i guess they tried to , but they bent their _unk .
well , i am supposed to give you up as part of honoring that agreement , but i am not that honorable a guy . <continued_utterance> i got ta go .
not in . <continued_utterance> this doll is cocaine . <continued_utterance> every part , from his ears to his accessory belt , is _unk , _unk cocaine . _unk . undetectable by dogs . undetectable by anyone .
you are lucky you did not break down in the desert . day like today , you would be dead in no time . when you leaving .
i do not know , but under no circumstances would i talk about it here . i want you to go home and relax the best you can . continue your life as if nothing has happened .
you know what you need , buddy buddy -- an _unk . that is when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your _unk -- to change that shitty attitude of yours .
you know what i think you should do now . why do not you pull some files . some files that were completed , others that went _unk , and i will have somebody run it down , talk to the customers and get some statements .
yes or no .
well , they do not `` seem ' ' to be that great so i cannot wait for this one . hey , here we are . two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame . bullets flying .
honestly , <person> . it is like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire .
apparently , you kept repeating it last night . you did sleep , <person> , and your advisor said you cried out , you had a nightmare .
<person> . <person> . if it will make you feel any better . <continued_utterance> i will keep it right here beside me all night . you know i am a light sleeper and a damn good shot . are you satisfied .
yeah . but i did . and i told you all about it .
you said , `` <person> ' ' , so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder .
well , i robbed a gas station once , and i robbed a couple of liquor stores , and some convenience stores . and that is it .
you do not want to be late . she is in agony . he turns and walks away .
what is with him . the kid ' s doing really great .
your last piece in the independent , the one about <person> , was brilliant . i am <person> , <person> . <person> , this man is the greatest living expert on <person> and <person> --
the _unk moment .
what . yeah . <continued_utterance> <person> .
<person> , it is rather simple . those risks that you love to take on the golf course , the risks you talk so passionately and _unk about -- you need to apply those risks to your personal life with the same passion .
no , we are going to plow it . just give me `til the autumn . i will pay every penny i owe you . with interest .
you cannot work if you cannot think . you get in bed . it is all right . i will stay here with you . it is all right . come on .
oh shit , i cannot take this anymore .
all you have to do is dream pink _unk , <person> , and we can make them happen . give me your address and i will send you our _unk catalogue .
do you both realize that neither of you can be buried on hallowed ground because of these . these _unk . does your bioport manual tell you that .
fools . you should never have come to this place . we are all going to die . <continued_utterance> we have got to get off this island right now . <person> . the boat . it is our only chance .
he is just _unk . <person> put him up to it . before evening sun sets , i would have his belongings back on <person> <number> , that old fox .
well , i do not think i have seen you since the reception at dean _unk ' s last year . <continued_utterance> for the dupont chair . i swear . i am becoming the nosy old lady i used to run from at _unk .
<person> idea . <continued_utterance> dear _unk . how do i love thee . let me count the . i , <person> <person> , of sound mind and body . hey .
inspiring -- now what am i doing here .
i got into stereo equipment when i was a kid . some people do not notice the difference but it is very important to me .
he did not do anything . he just told me his theory . it is sad when patients get like that . they loose reality . david <person> what the hell are you doing .
actually , it is not that i do not want to go . it is just that i have never been on a boat and i am not sure i can handle it .
there is a waiter blocking , i cannot see her face . he is serving her a cup of tea and she is putting in three _unk of sugar --
she never mentioned you . <continued_utterance> then again , she did not say much about her college friends . she gives claire the once over . <continued_utterance> i am watchin ' my shows .
how much do i pay him .
i was afraid you would think that . i am sorry to have to do this , but you really are stuck . <person> , would you come in now please .
no , no , of course , do not be silly . right . well , figure something else out <person> but get it down for the performance . put her in the _unk tank for now . <continued_utterance> you better start on that elephant .
you heard about it . . i was lucky .
we will pay a little , but not much . - you see , the audience will be _unk pigs -- and for us , that is quite an improvement .
i have been doing this a long time , _unk . i feel this kid in my bones .
will you please cut it out for a second , huh . i did not have any coffee either , it took me forever at the goddamn <person> .
what if , you know . we have to pee .
maybe , maybe , but no matter how many times i have to repeat : my primary goal ' s to get out of concrete .
put a lid on it , thelma . it is hard enough as it is . just let me get this part over with . now stay here and guard the money . if there is any problem i am in room <number> .
if you are anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we did not want you when you were born , so who cares if we are dead . am i right .
because an explosion like that would kill all the other _unk . there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world .
in my back yard . i lied before . it is hardly started . but when it is done , it will have twice the power of this one --
are you planning to collect radios .
_unk attorney <person> is accusing the los angeles police department in general , and lt . <person> in particular , of murder at worst , gross incompetence at best . '
uh - now , please do not be angry with me . i will - i will do anything you say , only . only if you do not shout at me . it makes me nervous .
some of this shit might actually
you should have never let him sleep in your pajamas , <person> . his problems do not go away just because you want them too .
you too , <person> .
i will speak to him . <continued_utterance> now , if you will excuse me , i .
that is pride and vanity that talks . not leadership . have you forgotten everything i have taught you . what of a warrior ' s patience , cunning .
are you <person> .
so what do you want me to do .
i spoke with the woman who saved your life . you are lucky she came along when she did . grady considers the larger ramifications of this statement
get me a couple juicy pictures . <person> ' i can wise the rabbit up with .
they had a rough life . your father was a _unk . your mother was , well , a two-bit stripper . there was no place for a baby .
<person> . i cannot give out that number .
you know <person> ' s doing really well with wrestling here , <person> . the _unk are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states .
i am giving you a chance here : talk to me . you can influence how this thing _unk .
<person> for you . now why do not you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you did not go through all this for my benefit .
but no book . let me see , let me see . wait a minute . there is a book with a flower , so it must be her .
what sort of case is it , <person> .
if i really knew you , i know what i would find -- instead of a brain , a cash register , instead of a heart , a bottom line . <person> is shocked at herself .
<person> , it is fun for them , but it is heaven for me . those goofy bastards are just about the best thing i have in this crazy old world . <person> , hey , i got ta run .
you know , i do not think i ever told you i was sorry about your little friend . what was his name . <continued_utterance> come on , <person> , help me out here . you know his name .
they must have grabbed her during the night . we did not know .
i will fuck your father in the shower .
<person> begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world . <person> is completely overwhelmed .
but what if it does not . what if it just goes on and on forever . or what if it is round .
i tend to like em with a little more meat on the bones . <person> aint bad , though . <person> gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle . <continued_utterance> whats wrong , sweetheart . somethin botherin you .
i got ta get going , i will miss my plane .
what is the point . there is nothing here . the map ' s a fake . <person> , even i see that now . we are just wasting our time . we might as well give up and --
. and i have inquiries out to doctors , experts in the field . there is , of course , a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor ' s negligent .
he hid one of the men who was supposed to be tossed . <person> was the train was over a _unk instead of land . nobody comes back from that .
she never mentioned her father .
it as not broke .
i am sorry but we have little to spare . the cardinal ' s guards were here today . they helped themselves to our food and then refused to pay .
old lady had her tested once . they said her iq was way up there , round two hundred or some such shit . that girl could do just about anything , she put her mind to it .
they are in a hurry to grow up . they do not know about consequences or responsibility . that is being sixteen too . i promise you one thing .
look up the chickens , dig up the holy dirt , pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long , stick it all on a big fucking tug boat . the whole country picks up and takes mexico .
if we do , it _unk the credibility of the quarantine . he will just send more through tomorrow .
give me a hand . <continued_utterance> poor old <person> , a few drinks , a fight with the sheriff over his wife . and both of ' em ended up dead . <person> takes his boots . <continued_utterance> time to go for a walk , <person> .
i am happier in new york , sure , things are great . you guys .
may i respond . first of all , i do not appreciate being spoken to with that kind of language . that is not the way i talk to you , and i would appreciate it if you would not talk that way to me --
god , i do not get it . are we supposed to say to ourselves , be prepared to lose her , be prepared to lose our child . why does this happen to someone . how does it happen .
heat , i think . the _unk invasion of a host , the fireman , and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six .
you exist , all right . that is the problem .
who are you . what the hell is this .
i said forget it , answer ' s no , i <person> ' t want the job and that is final . i am going to <person> and <person> ' short of dyin ' s _unk stop me . good day .
i tried , believe me , but <person> would not have it . it was too _unk for him . <person> was a grounded guy . an _unk . to a cop , the explanation is never that complicated . it is always simple . there is
there is nothing to do . <person> turns back to the children and waves . jeremy i cannot play . i am working out with my dad .
i told you , this is a shortcut . <person> , you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway . this used to be called _unk <number> ' because there is an amazing view of the _unk
and they want to blame us .
maybe . but that is not the real reason . you think if i tell , he will disappear and that is what you want . me all to yourself .
it should be . it is yours . i want our debt forgiven . i want to be the exclusive distributor of _unk brothers cocaine for the united states . and i want the principle witness against my husband , <person> , killed .
<person> . i want the course record . now gim me the lumber .
you are saying a white guy did it .
poor soul , he was so high-strung . afraid the strain was more than he could bear . <continued_utterance> let us go . my horse is over here .
it is not like i did not have ideas , i had plenty of ideas . but i never even shared them with your father .
that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen , so their deaths and the reason for them would not have to be explained --
i do not know . -- is it important . filby no , i suppose not . - only . what three books would you have taken .
no . the truth . she thought i was dead -- those blades were meant for you . what do you know that she would kill you for .
<person> was a patriot . the men he is loyal to know their way around dallas . they blew that building to hide something . maybe something even they could not predict .
my brother . i will not let you down . to the team . <continued_utterance> hey , what should i wear to practice .
around four . <person> and these _unk _unk ' _unk like punks . the only thing that was keepin ' him _unk ' was <person> . is he really dead .
<person> , no . i am putting that in the bank for you for when you really need it -- cuss me now , thank me later .
you are always so generous with my money .
i am not sure i like the idea of all this overhead breathing down my neck . when you have a place like this , that is a lot of overhead .
fear . the fear of being poor i guess , just like you , <person> . but that is all gon na change sweetheart . i am catching the express . . and you are going along for the ride .
oh come on , do not feel bad . you got played , so what . you are new at this . did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out .
well he is handsome and he is charming . he is all right . for now . <person> ' t say it , i know , i am <person> . i cannot help it . i have <person> to be good but it is too boring .
oh , do not be silly . no one your age just wants to go home . besides , faculty will be present . just think of it as a field trip .
that is just one example . my reporting has made a difference .
he is . that is , he was . he switched careers and became a physicist . he is quite brilliant , really . <continued_utterance> if you would just release him to me , i promise to keep an eye on him .
really , <person> , you got more scenarios swimmin around in your brain than <person> got pills . <person> to take it easy . go over to <person> for a few days .
just his instincts . he was well trained by e . i . o . maybe the memory cap ' s fractured . portions of his prior identity could be leaking through .
he has debts . he has gambling debts . he owes a lot of money .
<person> . i am coming . <person> down . <continued_utterance> why is that .
ahh . so what you are saying is that all your speeches about swimming across the shark infested waters are really just about your golf game -- not about your personal life .
times being what they were , i accepted the job , -- _unk my balloon against the _unk of a quick _unk . and in that balloon , my dear <person> , you and i will return to the land of e _unk _unk .
<person> , not dangerous . he was distraught when he found out that you would taken all of our research . it was years of his life , gone . he got depressed , started drinking , and . well , you know the rest .
oh . i assumed you would just look him in the eye and say `` gim me a break , for crissakes , <person> , are you a spy or are not you . ' '
alright . i changed my mind . i will have a margarita with and a shot of _unk on the side , please .
shoot <person> in the head with a gun . now im beginning to get it . you want me to shoot <person> in the head with a gun .
<person> ' like what . . how am i supposed to act . ' scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody ' s head off .
<person> , <person> . we are _unk .
meanness . let me tell you --
i can get <number> <person> here in about <number> minutes . they are on maneuvers out of <person> .
you listen to me . you take your _unk bullshit and you run it down the road . run it out on someone who does not know you like i do .
anonymous . <continued_utterance> i have been getting _unk my whole life . it is what they expect . after all this , i still have not figured it out .
i cannot help it . he gives me the creeps . i mean why was <person> so scared of him . she is not that way . i think he did something .
march into jotunheim as you once did , teach them a lesson , break their spirits so they will never dare try to cross our borders again .
<person> right you are scared . i can see it in your eyes . <continued_utterance> go ahead . <person> it . <person> that <person> wagon and see what happens .
<person> ' s mother ' s called three times this morning . said she has not heard from her daughter since before she left and she did not show up for work yesterday or today .
it was not constructed for its aesthetic values , you know , but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter . now go on .
now look , here is something that really has a heart . this is the best invention i ever invented .
it is out of the question . we are a fixture in the neighborhood . we are practically a landmark . men for women , women for men , women for women -- what is this .
i am not sure i made the slightest difference . i tried . i really did .
that is your problem . make arrangements , a deal ' s a deal .
now that he is in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . <person> is going to evolve .
i am making you uncomfortable . baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing _unk screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that does not bother you . but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull .
i am a terrible friend .
all we can do now is hope our plan works .
we grow most of our own food . the money i get from social security , my pension and my wife ' s work , keeps us living on the edge . what choice do people like us have .
but i want a baby . a family . i want to _unk him and change him and . love him . why could not it have been with me .
yeah . well , i have got a little problem . the guys at the bank want to take my house away . that is kind of why i came to see you , actually .
<person> , <person> , you know it is not that easy .
i just wanted to save you from the life of a musketeer . you do not have to go looking for experience , d ' <person> . it will find you soon enough . and when it does -- it will mark you forever .
<person> , i am a civilian . this is my place . used to be the royal family ' s , now it is mine . i run my little business , i stay out of trouble .
mary _unk . she will not talk to me . i tried her at the hospital . i am going to try her back at home . read this .
-- no . no offense to the old man . i appreciate you trying to help . but i put my ass on the line coming out here , man .
we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters , <person> . i do not know about uranium , i do not know about <person> -- all i know is we did our job . it is over .
this is not a good time to take chances . your best friend , <person> , an accountant , lost his home and is out on the street . we see him from time to time . he comes down to church for a free meal .
yes . you will . <person> , i still want you in charge , even though your cover is blown . just keep a low profile . i generally prefer it when my covert operations do not make the front page .
all right . see this animal . this here is the stupidest goddamn animal on the face of god ' s good earth . here is your bull hook . you are gon na need it .
we can fight . that is what we are here for : to fight the iraqis . to help the <person> ' ites , and the _unk .
today , you are glad to have the boa on your side . <continued_utterance> in the good old days , the kgb had three or four spots where our _unk could surface without anyone knowing . but <person> is supposed to be loading cargo .
he was a _unk heart attack waiting to happen -- cost me three strokes a side . i carried my bag the last four holes . i love ol ' <person> but i need you .
no . i would hit it again because that shot was a defining moment . and when a defining moment comes along you define the moment or the moment defines you . i did not shrink from the challenge . i rose to it .
this is the perfect time to panic . i am lost , <person> is gone , they are going to move from their house in two days and it is all your fault . .
it is no my fault i was born first . besides , nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation , so ease up on the sad sack stuff .
she dropped a million and half dollars to the house -- your house . and you did not even bat an eyelid . she was paying you off . what for .
not much to tell , is there . just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire . no big deal .
i also called <continued_utterance> they told me they do not help out _unk . <person> , maybe they are right , it is been a long time .
i can be better . i will be . and i hate the way i am anymore . i do not know why i do it . what about that stenotyping thing you were gon na do .
there were no drugs on that boat . it was a hit . a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser <person> so <person> had a few thieves put to it . men he knew he could march into certain death .
are you <person> ' s mother .
i am still working on it . <continued_utterance> remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidentally started frying kids ' brains .
<person> ' s in pittsburgh .
you are a _unk . <person> check his wallet .
because we do not . it is a rule . that is the tree of the knowledge of good and <person> . you do not eat from that one . nobody ever has .
you are right . it is not a joke . <person> , i know a little about the amish . i know this has to be an ordeal for you ; and i am really sorry you an <person> got involved . <continued_utterance> what was that .
i am sorry . this is <person> . she works for the hotel and helps out as a translator .
then how the hell can you be in my dream -- if you know it is just a dream .
not an option . just get up slowly like everything ' s cool . <person> , trust me . you just hung yourself out to dry for me , i am not gon na let you down .
you have always liked your men mean . she looks up at me . feels the shame i _unk . <continued_utterance> what would mom and dad say . <continued_utterance> nothing . that is where i learned it .
no , no . they will think it is a bad omen . there ' ll be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybody ' ll blame me for it .
i do not like them that way because they get hot in the hand and it is hard to scoop the stuff out . it is not good . and you get little bits of shell in there and it does not taste good .
we are gon na have to step in , <person> . <person> boys could not find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .
my name is <person> , czech secret police . when you are here you are under my jurisdiction , you take my orders , you do what i say . if you become any kind of an inconvenience , i will shoot you .
this is not like a journey to earth , where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god . this is <person> .
<person> . ok . but the bank has got to go by the new _unk figures . according to these figures , you are upside down on your mortgage --
what you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man ' s wallet .
i am mad at you . and at landon . and the universe . and god . i do not even know where to put all my anger .
just some young guy . <person> twenty years old . <person> hair . <continued_utterance> they said they would picked him up along the way . he was a student . but he did not look right . but he left when they got to the motel .
well , that sounds inviting .
oh , thanks a lot . i feel so much better now . here , this is a rabbit for your baby . thanks again , ' bye , i am so happy .
how deep does this go .
<person> up , <person> . you are annoying . <person> and <person> do not know what the fuck they are talking about , okay . the entire class _unk including the lovely <person> about one tenth of one percent the talent you have , okay .
because it looks good . <continued_utterance> i am just not like you . ya know . i am never going to go to yale . i am never going to be `` <person> ' ' .
but it must be planted , cultivated , nurtured . unless . unless you have an economy so well organized that you can devote all your time to study and experimentation .
a simple , unstoppable _unk . what is a virus but a _unk force that can not be defeated . living in a cave , underground , until it _unk . and attacks .
<person> . i will get you your money . i just have to get something out of the trunk . <continued_utterance> what the fuck did you do to my trunk .
you mutant bastards . <continued_utterance> whatever you do to me . no matter what youandiacute ; ll make me right . every word i have spoken will be confirmed .
i do not know how two brothers can be so different .
oh , yeah . go ahead . <continued_utterance> i am glad i did not have to kill you . i am glad it did not come to that .
no . hate the fear inside of you . <person> like a man mister . hate it . hate it away . hate your way up one more rung . . do it right now . .
no , you have talked about it and i have listened . in my opinion , <person> ' s smile is not _unk regression and it is not confused libido . it is one good looking guy drooling over you , <person> .
oh no , no .
put it up someplace <person> cannot get it . <continued_utterance> friends .
<person> . <person> page .
. well he does not talk back or steal the silver and <person> ' s gon na get me an _unk on him , are not you .
then remember , you are the heir to a billion dollar empire . you have a staff of literally thousands . <person> everything you ever imagined by a million and you still cannot even wrap your head around everything that is yours . all
come over to my place tonight . we are having a huge party . come around <number> , okay . see ya later . <continued_utterance> as exquisite as you are . i think i am gon na faint .
you are the fbi . that is your job , is not it . ya know how many of our warrior brothers got killed out here . i never saw any investigating then . why now . what is going down here .

i will be around long after you are dead , <person> . you slime . when i get outa here i will cut your head off and stick it on a _unk .
a window onto the human condition .
different culture . <person> to penetrate . the indians do not like white cops poking around . and that is why we are in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent .
great . he is _unk the place . no one is allowed to work in his department who does not have a ph . d . in children ' s literature .
you do not . that is the point . <continued_utterance> <person> , none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself . some of us remember how your father --
_unk . <continued_utterance> we will have to resume this another time , <person> . it is been an emotionally exhausting weekend . my parents are in an uproar over <person> . he is moved some _unk in with him up in the studio over the garage .
well , when somebody slams into us and you go _unk ' through the windshield , that is liable to be uncomfortable too . so put on your seat belt .
i was kidnapped . they killed _unk . mutants . there was a light . a bright . light . <person> turns to <person> , looking deep into his eyes .
i could take after dad , too .
friend . baseball bat .
the plane . it is all been arranged .
the fact that you attend this school makes you privileged . <continued_utterance> finally , i would like you to join the drama club . rehearsals are tuesday and thursday evenings .
for your information , the ' fucking ' baby ' s name is <person> . and if i were you , i would watch what i said about her . because she just so happens to be your daughter .
it is the depression , cornell . where have you been . oh right - cornell . <continued_utterance> here , use <person> ' s second bucket for now . <continued_utterance> you barely use up one .
fifteen seconds . perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney .
one thing puzzles my mind , sugar . youre twenty years old - arent you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin us apart . puttin a detective on us . <person> tell ya <person> . well . its moren me killin <person> .
it is called pasta now <person> , spaghetti ' s out of date .
i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really . make no mistake , i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for .
were you on deck . i was standing right there and all i know is , he . . disobeyed an order , twice , and the boat went over .
to us indians , our spiritual relatives are as close as family . i have got seven mothers on this reservation . sisters . brothers . you as not one of them .
<person> disappeared . <person> was _unk a hard lesson . what i learned from _unk <person> is i think people who are frightened want to disappear . _unk startin _unk weird . like comin up to people every fifteen minutes and askin how they were doin .
the bow ' s coming off . he is ripping the wrapping paper . it is a . it is . it is a _unk . we have got a _unk , here .
in the darkest moments , it is what i live for . especially since i have heard how much you like to watch . on the hidden camera .
one day hes gon na find out what were up to with mr . <person> , and he could cause us a lot of trouble . <continued_utterance> im gon na take your silence as a yes .
that is what i am saying .
why cannot we have pot roast or _unk or even a little london _unk . i mean , for god ' s sake , we own a grocery store .
<person> . you have got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail . so , here is the plan : you and heather go for help . get to the mountains .
the men who came to see you at leavenworth . the one ' s who made the arrangement . who were they . maybe i can talk to them .
i have got my dr . <person> , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains .
i did . i got there at eleven like you said , right as two black and white ' s pulled up : you were out cold in a gutter `round the block . <person> knock you out .
your phone ' s breaking up <person> . i am not joking when i say it is packed over here .
wherever it was , you cannot be doing it , alright . i mean this is a serious -- shit , he is here . <continued_utterance> this is a serious problem . <continued_utterance> guy has not been inside a school since <number> - <number> .
why not miracle waters . i have drunk the oil of monkey glands , been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in _unk . after all that , this sounds downright peaceful .
two-hundred dollars . i will do it . i will kill her .
never . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s got a hard-on . <continued_utterance> you are still a virgin , i can tell . maybe that is why i like you . <continued_utterance> kiss me , you _unk .
<person> , check out <person> , it is still not over .
of the six prison inmates you have tested all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only mr . <person> is still breathing .
things aint real hot right now . <person> , there though , is about to relocate in about a week to san angelo . i might could use a man when he does . you good with engines .
i do not know . i was just wondering about my work and all . i mean , what is it i do exactly . all i really do is run a bookstore --
really . <continued_utterance> that is an interesting idea . actually , i just wanted to ask you .
i do not know . warm stuff , i guess . it is the mountains . i guess it gets cold at night . i am just gon na bring everything .
i out rank you , that is why .
do you know the reason why i try to recruit guys like you . there is no risk . <continued_utterance> there is nobody back home who is gon na ask questions if you just . disappear for a while .
- but as i have explained to <person> , without proof , there is just no story . <person> ' t you agree mr . <person> .
and who he is . she has to . i want access to her _unk sheet or whatever arrest records exist . <person> was <person> _unk her out to dealers he did business with .
i am sitting on a two shot lead with three to go , and my partner ' s in his pocket . suddenly , par ' s a good number . gim me the seven iron .
that is right , <person> . but not you . not us . <continued_utterance> as it is , we can barely scrape by on your lousy ten thousand a week . she leaves the room . he _unk on what she said , depressed .
look , i loved `` exposed . ' ' and i hate it that you got busted . i know the school paper sucks in comparison , but it is really not that bad .
carrying out our mission , mr . secretary . if you do not mind , we are very busy right now . we need to be able to do our jobs .
well i am glad your done lying now , just in time to lose your practice . that is how we survive , <person> . your family . you ever think of that .
it will turn black again soon enough . then i guess i will be losing the whole thing . . think my toes are already gone . <continued_utterance> so you are the only one who made it .
well , we just started out , and if we had some really good hard facts of some _unk , it would give us a lot of credibility in the community .
in the service you do , but we are not particularly in the service right now . way i see it , what we are doing , that does not particularly give you the right to toss orders around .
okay , give me that .
are you crazy . i have unleashed a psycho on her . she is gon na be fucking pissed . she is even more beautiful than i remember . <continued_utterance> you asshole , what are you -- <continued_utterance> <person> . is that you .
<person> . you keep calling me <person> . you did it just now . you did before , just after i woke up . you called me <person> . nobody calls me <person> .
look at me , dude , do i look like a fan of law enforcement . forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . i woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
no . ever accept any of your <number> , <number> proposals .
<person> , <person> , the truth is . i will be in town for a while now but i do not think we should see each other for a few weeks .
sure . lots of guys at the track talk like that . but how do you know you will have any dough next month . what is this . i gave you two hundred .
so i am standing there and you could hear a pin drop . no breathing or snoring . suddenly it hits me that somethin ' was goin ' on that just stopped , really fast , like people are holding their breath .
that would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of <number> million dollars .
i do not know about <person> . but i did not go near that plasma . but i guess you will all rest easier if someone else is in charge . <continued_utterance> cannot see anyone _unk to you , _unk .
you are a liar .
yeah , i guess he still lives with her . <person> like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so i went out on a limb and got him transferred down to providence .
<person> started out bad . couple of bikers from out of town tried to knock over <person> ' s grocery store this morning . it was a real shootout .
i just wanted to say how sorry i was about the match and if i did anything to cause it then i will never forgive myself . i know how much wrestling means to you , baby .
i mean anybody . <continued_utterance> i heard what <person> said to you . he said , `` we have enemies in our own house . `` he said it as he was dying .
yes . <number> . he was furious at the british plan to return hong kong , and supposedly started his own negotiations with the chinese government . the inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn mi- <number> a rather powerful enemy -
you know what i have got at stake with this paper . you know that . i cannot help but think that you are doing this now to hurt me , or to sabotage me somehow .
you know , we never did control it . not really . not like we think . <continued_utterance> but we did our best . now it is up to them .
<person> , like <person> on tax day . get the keys . darrell well , there is a $ <number> overnight storage charge we got to talk about . <continued_utterance> all i got ' s a hundred , <person> . you got change .
<person> , i have been getting phone calls , every fifteen minutes or so . i think it is a man . he is trying to scare me .
mom , great . but what i want is for me to be proud of me .
<person> , it is got nothing to do with the money .
i looked the other way when you did a lot of foul things but i <person> ' t lettin ' you torment a dyin ' man . not as long as he is under my roof . i draw the line there .
i am telling you , the only way to change this is to get <person> to call off his old man . and that as not gon na happen . so the way i see it , it is <person> or us .
you say you get a million , you get the million . some cop gives us shit , he is dead . <person> , man , you are _unk .
so then there is more talk about the wind . while you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous . and when you finally get back , you have to clean up the boat .
oh , i been a lotta different places . um . i went down to florida for a while . i was doing some work in _unk . i have been all over the place .
you saw what those animals did at that rancho . you think a border is going to stop me . no , i am going to see them suffer for what they did . i swear it on my soul .
<person> , sir . uh . here is what we got . <continued_utterance> <person> . we think he is dirty so we raid his financial files . check it out . <continued_utterance> one hundred million in wire _unk from the commerce bank

you bet your ass i am right . you do not go out with a loaded gun , you empty the barrels .
steroids . he is a bit of a fitness nut . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> a .
if i do not adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving , he will not be able to walk when i take him out of
you think i do . . <person> . i am just as freaked by what is happening as you . but we have to deal with it , `cause like it or not , it is happening .
nothing makes the great spirit laugh harder than a man ' s plans . we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you did not plan on _unk into town .
you are a pile of sticks and dung .
captain <person> ' s ferry was late . he runs the line across the strait between here and <person> . the lumber mill workers coming back for the weekend missed the last bus . <person> on the docks . hundreds of them .
who are we fooling . this will never work . they will never let me back into politics . they will never see past my legs .
it will prove to her that i am not who she thinks i am .
i was defending myself . he was stealing from me .
<person> , it is <person> . i missed my audition . i lost my head . <person> , i have to go . i am with <person> .
is there anything else you can do for money .
no it is not .
it attacks the nervous system . people suffering from it are _unk compelled to utter _unk , sometimes one , sometimes a whole string of them . they cannot control it .
well , yeah , of course , but . let me , uh , let me call <person> .
-- i know you do not suck at acting . <continued_utterance> but you have to make it a big joke because only dorks and _unk like doing theater --
yes . it is good that someone can have the use of them . besides , in your clothes you would stand out to strangers . <continued_utterance> i should tell you these do not have buttons . <person> . hooks and eyes .
i knew i would like you .
' important business . ' <continued_utterance> i understand . men make bold plans in secret . and women wait . to mourn , or to celebrate the outcome . i know from experience , it is a lonely _unk .
oh , you mean somebody who as not scared of a twelve gauge shotgun . and then what did they do . camp out down below and just wait for him to die .
i am very serious , <person> . there is no time to lose . now she _unk her light so that <person> backs away , completely covering his face .
they say that if somebody ' s holding a gun on you , you should never stop talking . that is the theory -- who knows . . <continued_utterance> maybe it is a good thing that i talk too much .
you do not play games with homicide police . there are no options here . there is not the luxury of worrying about how the fallout will settle .
a man of faith . how delightful . whatever you are paying him , double it . i want the king ' s birthday to be a memorable event . and _unk this painting in my chamber . just as it is .
-<person> did you load that gun . <person> nods , `` yes . `` crying harder now . jeremy -you will not get hurt . <continued_utterance> -<person> was wrong .
no . <person> . <person> , <person> , i am counting on you . you calm her down . i mean do whatever you have to , whatever it takes .
he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to . <person> has been
of course not . you were just chosen again . maybe after you and the princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself . she walks off before he can answer .
her face had a sour look . that means we are going to have trouble with the local authorities . they are not going to be receptive to the fbi .
yeah . and i will go for it tomorrow and i will go for it sunday , cuz i did not come here to play for no second .
. and he is making a billion dollars every minute working for <person> , <person> , and he bought a dog , and everything is rosy . then mr . <person> , he tried to fix a case .
hey . i never said you was a pussy . always figured you had the big ol round balls for this kinda thing . sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good .
now you are gon na make me enjoy this , funny guy . now i am gon na take the whole foot off . <person> think of that . <continued_utterance> what is that , eh . i thought you did not have no friends .

when i heard about the miracle horse , i traveled three days because i knew whose horse it was . my granddaughter ' s . she saved his life . he was everything to her .
he is kind of a miracle .
my . my neck . my . my neck . <person> . oh -- bang on my chest if you think i am perfect . go ahead -- bang on it .
then call <person> about this dead <person> . i am no legal mind like you , but i will bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick . collect the rest of your money .
i know . <continued_utterance> i need to ask you something . and i need you to tell me the truth . <continued_utterance> who is it . who is trying to kill me .
oh , no , no . i will not let you take him . you go away , you . . <person> , i will bite you myself .

jake never gives me more ' n twenty bucks at a time , like a bird in a cage , he do not want me goin ' anywhere .
so he is got ta do something , right . let him wrestle . <person> at this way , you are helping out the old man and this kid ' s a little bonus for doing the right thing .
<person> . <continued_utterance> he is gone . <person> and those boys are a pain in the backside . i am sure that cousin of his had it coming .
and if you think you can fuck me , do not . cause i am fucking _unk <person> . protected . backed up on floppy . do you get me . i want my fucking money .
no . i do not want freedom . i want a marriage . i want a life with you .
did the tuning fork ring in your _unk .
that may be why <person> ' s introducing this guy . we have been burned by his usual players in the formal channels , so he brings in an honest broker .
he do not talk about it because he cannot . there are not words for some things . come here . <continued_utterance> the mice ' ve been at it . <person> down .
well , i will tell you what the bride will do : the bride will get up and walk over there and slap hell out of the bride ' s son . now does the bride ' s son want his face slapped .

be careful <person> . he is dangerous . <continued_utterance> <person> _unk , the best inspector in the lapd , digging . he will find <person> and when he does he will find <person> . then <person> . <continued_utterance> where is he .
you got your son back . <continued_utterance> you know , part of the reason i stuck around was `cause i thought i would finally get you all to myself . but you did not have any interest in training me . <person> was the one .
it is a distant castle , where a great king and queen will look after <person> and keep her safe until she is old enough to rule .
you even brought the plane for us . we really could not have done it without you . <continued_utterance> a man tires of being executed . <continued_utterance> but then again . there is no point in living if you cannot . feel alive .
hopefully , it will not get that far .

yeah . so am i .
he was a small man . oh _unk face down in the sand .
one hundred . ninety-nine . ninety-eight . ninety-seven . ninety-six . ninety-five . his voice drops off ; his eyes close . lull studies him , adjusts some instruments , then turns to <person> , glancing briefly at a typed sheet in front of her .
what is the lure , <person> . obviously not his character . is it the money . the luxury . what is any of that worth if you are getting shot at and you could go to jail .
you lie about everything . you say you are not worried but it is clear you are . i know the war is approaching but you say , `` oh , it is just a trick of the wind . ``
what do you mean . <continued_utterance> what are you going to do with me .
i am gon na find out everything about this son of a bitch , and then i am gon na find the one thing that cuts him to the quick .
como esta , amigo . i have with me one of the legendary ball _unk in the history of golf -- the security guard strains to see in .
you know what , <person> . it is personal . this is a personal matter that has to do with <person> . i just have to go see her for a little while .
why would he fake it . he is not <person> .
that sounds like a game that is not going to be easy to market .
<person> . you and i can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up , talking about what is right and what is wrong . you are from the reservation . it is a different world .
i do not know . i have to make a stop in vegas . business to finish . then maybe i will head to <person> . i might be able to pick up some action there .
it was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce , whatever it ate or absorbed , cell for cell . <continued_utterance> the concept is staggering . i know . i . i do not fully understand it myself .
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus . its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we have so _unk protected for the last fifty years . or it may not .
what killed them i will not even write about . i tell you , they would do more than just harass me . they have the future to protect .
i wish . he just kept _unk everything . my dolls were alter egos . boys who wanted to kiss me were _unk _unk _unk looking to _unk their mothers on their _unk family _unk .
<person> explains how you found out i was from delaware . but not how you knew i needed a ride home . i mean , i always fly . how could you possibly know that for , like the
<person> , look at you . <person> inside man . <continued_utterance> you and <person> training together like nothing ever happened . this is unbelievable . now i know what you are really doing here .
<person> , that idea has promise .
<person> . i am sure , if you put your mind to it , you can think of some other way of getting back at me besides this . so would you please just give it some thought , and take him fishing tomorrow .
sure . my mom and lance are going to a movie and i am planning on stealing <person> ' s trailer and _unk it in a parking lot , so you will have the whole house to yourself .
i will , <person> . <person> now . <continued_utterance> i thought you two were in austin , texas . or _unk , as they say in these parts .
then why are not you testifying for their side . <continued_utterance> i can subpoena you , you know . i can get you up there on the stand .
what happened to this circus .
<person> , you do not know what you are talking about . quit trying to hold on so tight . i am gone . long gone like a turkey through the corn .
absolutely not . <continued_utterance> i ' <number> have this thing in front of a grand jury by monday .
what does that mean .
i do not make no bones about where i am going to spend eternity . i have always been wild and you know that . if you are made to feel half a man , what do you think the other half is .
what do you want me to say . everything you said about me was true , <person> . i was just a big chickenshit jerk , and now i am payin ' the price .
what do i know , eh . <person> needs a victory very badly . he needs to prove to <person> that he is still winning . he thinks <person> ' s death is the proof he needs .
<person> ' t worry about it .
you sure the little man did not fry your brain , <person> .
i guess . <person> never tells <person> the truth about how much he pays for these things .
i tried everything . a spoon . i poured milk into her mouth , she just spat it out . i do not know what to do , i am not a mother .
hey , are we talking about the same thing .

yeah . personal effects include a watch , under garments , and a blue waitress uniform . the ring is missing . it says the rest of her things have not been removed yet from the trailer . <person> ' s hope it is there .
we got a bunch of smart guys . we lock ' em up together in there , kick ' em in the ass til they come up with options . <continued_utterance> i will do it .
maybe it is time to publish that story about his sex life . even things up . a close race is always better for our tv ratings .
the school _unk used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . my award winning _unk changed all that . the city added an extra _unk trash pick-up .
we are not barbarians .
me neither . i am terrified to look under the plates . <continued_utterance> this `` support for the _unk ' ' thing does not sound too good .
maybe it is because if he adores himself and spends every moment _unk his desires , so then can she . <continued_utterance> she can become a child again . who would not want that .
no i am not . have you really looked at me . i am short . even for a _unk . <continued_utterance> why cannot you do it . you have _unk _unk powers .
a blue rose .
you should not worry about me .
my guess is there is not enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring , but we should do a _unk of this anyway .
<person> , it is too much of a tangle . i already cast my lot . i cannot go <person> and i cannot sneak , feel back enough as it is .
so why do not you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan .
i do not know how .
no . though i have no way to prove otherwise . the virus is extraterrestrial . we know very little about it , except that it is the original _unk of this planet .
i am meeting a player from temple university . he is a _unk . you like football .
i am afraid she will say no .
two minutes , madam , and we will be out of here . we just need the picture for <person> , and we will be out of here .

`` long life to the grape . for when summer is flown , the age of our _unk <person> _unk our own . `` that is <person> , you know .
they are pretty pissed off . they will do anything . now i got a way to do it without killing anyone : but like i said , they will not let me in without you .
i have seen enough . turn it off . <continued_utterance> they are degenerates . there is not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over .
i figure you probably want to do a little research on the history of <person> <person> ' s business connections in the third world countries with c . i . a . influence .
well , there is a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to <person> . we are broke . i am just a slave around this dump . now if you were capable of finding a better job .

i am saying it was not the hanta virus .
what hope is there for <person> .
it is not a bad thing , finding out that you do not have all the answers . that is when you start asking the right questions .
i do not buy that reform story for a minute . and even if i did , i certainly do not believe he would send you to protect her . so why .
<person> , stop king leaving .
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago .
